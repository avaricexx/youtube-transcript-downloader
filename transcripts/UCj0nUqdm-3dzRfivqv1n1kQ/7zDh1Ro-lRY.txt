hey guys what's going on megan here so
this is what happened when you bust a
nut right
following up on a video from last week
first your testosterone slightly goes up
as you approach ejaculation
same thing with your dopamine goes up up
up so that's the pre-nut period
you're on alpha mode you're motivated
you're ready to conquer the world
once you beat your meat or even just
have sex
boom this is what happened post not
right so soon as you start busting a nut
prolactin goes through the roof and then
your testosterone drops your dopamine
drops your testosterone drops
you feel like [ __ ] you feel tired you
feel sleepy you lose interest you don't
want to do [ __ ] for the rest of the day
right or for the next 30 minutes so
however long your refractory period is
and it's crucial to understand that
before we even talk about no fat but
anyway guys this is another episode of
sex talk saturday you guys know on
saturday we talk about anything sex
related
and of course the no fab questions do
not stop
me again do a video on low fat me again
do a video on those five
and i made videos on dopamine in the
past but i guess you guys want me to
explain how i relate to the fat
so first things first before we talk
about nofap let's talk about sex right
let's just
let's keep it real right between us guys
sex
rules the goddamn world all right i
don't want you to argue with me i don't
want you to don't ask questions it's a
fact
sex makes the world go around from
pre-history to
this day and age everything organisms do
is driven by the desire to have sex why
do you think
male lions fight each other for
territory why territory gives you
[ __ ]
why do buffaloes fight during mating
season the winner usually claps the most
buffalo cheeks
while the gorillas fight once again the
winner is the one that has to hire him
with all the females why do eagles fight
same thing for territory you have
territory you have food you have food
you have better access to females
even [ __ ] ass bugs why do insects fight
why do beatles fight
right the winner look he's tossing that
[ __ ] in the air just to be able to clap
some beetle cheeks
elephants why do elephants fight
especially during mating season the
winner is the one that has access to the
females
muskox even kangaroos same thing look
he's kicking the [ __ ] out of this [ __ ]
why again the winner gets to have sex
dear same reason why their fight the
winner gets to have the most sex
even [ __ ] fish guys
fight for territory and females i could
go on and on with
almost every species out there and
humans are not any different
almost every single thing we do whether
it's consciously or subconsciously
it eventually leads to sex it's driven
by a genetic desire a biological desire
to have sex right so let's not act as if
sex is this thing that's
optional and it's this taboo topic
whatever no
you would never understand human
psychology or human biology
unless you look at it from the context
of sex and why why why sex so important
simple to pass on your dreams to the
next generation right if you do not have
sex if you're not driven to have sex you
don't pass on your genes so your line
ends
so the simplest way to explain it is the
organisms that were not honey that were
not driven by the desire to have sex
that were not driven by the desire to
mate
were not willing to do dangerous [ __ ] to
have access to females
simply do not pass on their genes it's
that simple that's why we're a bunch of
honey [ __ ]
it has nothing to do with culture it's
all biology even [ __ ] [ __ ]
want to have sex and even if they would
never socialize or taught anything about
it
right so that's the first thing we have
to get out the way right you have to
understand the importance
of sex before we even talk about nofap
the second thing you have to understand
is dopamine obviously right
you guys know i always say the two most
important molecules to a man
is testosterone and dopamine and long
story short without making this video
too long
dopamine is simply what motivates you to
do [ __ ] right in layman's terms
i can go into the signs but then again
the video is going to be way too long
in layman's simple terms dopamine is
what motivates you to do [ __ ]
that's why when you drink coffee why do
you think you have a burst of energy
right coffee specifically caffeine bloxy
adenosine receptors
and one of the effects of that is it
increases dopamine right you motivate it
you focus you're more alert right
it's the neurotransmitter that makes you
ready to go out and do alpha [ __ ] makes
you ready to go hunt
makes you ready to go capture your prey
whatever whatever your goal is obviously
in the modern world
it's pretty much what makes you
productive cocaine how do you guys think
cocaine works cocaine works by
increasing dopamine right it's a
dopamine agonist so when people take
cocaine or even just
pure crack they exhibit the same effects
right high alertness high energy high
motivation that's why wall street
is loaded with investment bankers and
stock brokers and just a bunch of dudes
who just load up on cocaine because it
makes them
[ __ ] superhuman why do you think
crackheads have so much energy again
dopamine
adderall how do you guys think outerwear
works again dopamine pathway
even [ __ ] math which gives you the
biggest spike in dopamine out of any
other drug out there
it's all about dopamine guys anything
that has to do with focus alert energy
is through dopamine alright so whenever
you have a goal dopamine is what makes
you chase that goal the lower your
dopamine levels the less motivated
you're the less alert you are
the less focused you are and of course
you guys know testosterone is simply
what makes you want to do off the [ __ ]
what makes you want to do dangerous [ __ ]
right
so dopamine motivates you to just do
[ __ ] just as well motivation to do
dangerous things high effort things
things that are risky that's why when
your testosterone levels go up
you're more willing to take risks when
your testosterone levels go down you're
less likely to take risks
so the two molecules work with each
other dopamine increases testosterone
testosterone also increases dopamine
it's a huge chemical circle jerk right
so if you're a male
you have i repeat you have to understand
these two molecules there's no way
around it that's why if you look at any
entrepreneur
any person who's a high achieving male
you'll notice that they have high
testosterone levels
and they also have high dopamine levels
back to this chart here
same thing in animal kingdom the reason
why males fight
during mating season is because that's
also the season when the testosterone
levels are the highest
and the dopamine was also the highest
right so
motivation to do [ __ ] motivation to do
risky [ __ ]
now back to this chart pre-nut so that's
before you have sex so before you beat
your meat
notice your double mean levels are high
your testosterone levels are high right
so you're in alpha mode
you're ready to conquer the world you're
ready to just dominate your day whatever
the task
of the goal of the day is right once you
bust your nut
everything drops right your dopamine
levels plummet
your testosterone levels also
temporarily drop but mainly your
dopamine levels get
crushed to the ground and at the same
time your prolactin
goes through the roof right [ __ ] this
hormone here prolactin is pretty much
what makes you
satisfied it's what makes you lazy it's
what makes you
feel like you accomplish something right
and then you pretty much just relax for
the rest of the day so in short it makes
you lazy right
so you got to understand that those
molecules are always opposite of each
other
when your testosterone and your dopamine
is high your prolactin is low
when your prolactin is high your
testosterone and dopamine are low that's
why some doctors would actually check
your prolactin levels
whenever you hypogonadal to try to
figure out if you have lotus that's the
one that will actually check your
prolactin levels and that's also why if
your prolactin levels are too high
due to genetic conditions or constant
masturbation
you actually end up with erectile
dysfunction right a lot of doctors would
actually track your prolactin first
before they even check your testosterone
levels if you go there and say hey i
have erectile dysfunction they say all
right let's check your prolactin
and i already explained in the last
video the reason why nature
or evolution has created the system is
because i mean can you imagine if people
like them levels never went up
after having sex you're never gonna stop
you're literally gonna just clap cheeks
all day long because what's gonna make
you satisfied what's gonna make you feel
like you accomplished
you just constantly have sex all day
because let's be honest what else feels
better than sex
so the reason why when people do nofap
they report high alertness high
high energy and they feel confident
and all that is simply because of these
molecules that dopamine levels stay up
the testosterone levels stay elevated
and that prolactin is low
and as long as the dopamine interstates
are not elevated guess what
you motivated to do alpha [ __ ] and in
nature
doing alpha [ __ ] like hunting fighting
going to war whatever
is usually what results to you passing
on your dreams what results are you
having sex
you understand guys we were hunters and
gatherers for 99.4 percent of our
existence on this earth
we didn't become civilized until a few
thousand years ago when we decided to
build cities and
we discovered agriculture and [ __ ] right
but relative to how long we've been on
this earth
is zero point six percent of accesses
that means we were hunters and gatherers
for 99 of our existence and if you study
any hunter-gatherer tribe no matter
where it is in africa in asia wherever
you notice the same thing the best
hunter is usually the one that has
access to the most females or tends to
have the most kids as a hunter and
gallery you gotta prove yourself you
don't just become of age you say all
right i'm ready to have a wife no you
gotta prove
yourself whether through combat or
through being a really great hunter for
the tribe
and what two molecules are gonna help
you do this dopamine and testosterone
hunting is a very risky endeavor as you
can see here this guy lost his uh
his arm doing the hunt some people lose
their lives some people lose their eyes
right so to be a hunter you got to be
maxed out on testosterone and maxed out
on dopamine right
i'll for [ __ ] in today's day and age
obviously we don't have to hunt and [ __ ]
but it's the same thing right we have to
go out and do things you have to create
a business
or be an entrepreneur or fight or
whatever you have to do things
that are the equivalent of hunting in
the wild example being a boss being your
own uh being an entrepreneur being the
leader of a sports team being whatever
you know
why do you think females gravitate
towards those high value males
because it's the equivalent of pretty
much hunting right a successful hunter
today the person who's successful at
pretty much getting the prize you know
which is
in this money driven world money and
things like that and none of these are
possible
without those two molecules in order to
go out and hunt you need dopamine to
make you alert to make you focus to make
you motivated to give you energy by the
way even adrenaline
comes from dopamine most people don't
even notice you know your body needs
dopamine to make adrenaline
right and of course uh to go out and
hunt you need to stop strong because
hunting is risky same thing in today's
day and age to start a business or to uh
go into sports or to fight or whatever
that's the risky endeavor and the
problem with porn is it gives you
the pleasure of sex without making you
do alpha [ __ ] right because remember
back in the hunter-gatherer days you
actually had to do something to have sex
so you actually became something great
you became something better you became a
better male
in the process of chasing sex whereas
with porn
you're getting it for free just like
that open your laptop type right and
that's why men are weak these days man
up betas
men are simps subscribing to only fans
and [ __ ] out of shape
weak refuse to improve their lives why
because what's the point if you if
they're already getting
the pleasure the reward without having
to do office [ __ ] then what's the point
right so that's our point is ruining the
lives of so many men
you constantly busting us throughout the
day raising your prolactin levels
crushing your dopamine levels
and your testosterone levels but you're
not doing any of the alpha [ __ ]
that gets you that so essentially you're
hacking the system you're hacking the
system you're getting the spike because
remember when prolactin goes up
serotonin also goes up right which is
what makes you feel confident
and uh makes you feel like you're higher
on a social ladder right so
it's not necessarily bad to get that
spike if you did something alpha to get
it right if you did something epic to
get it because you actually deserve it
the problem is when you get this spike
what i leveling up prior to that
so really the conclusion here is that
it's not that pawn is essentially bad
it's not pointing itself that's bad it's
the fact that
you're not doing anything to earn that
ejaculation to earn that nut you got to
earn your nut
in fact one thing i used to do years ago
when i used to struggle with porn when i
used to struggle and i mean i used to
beat my meat all the [ __ ] time
one thing i used to do is i didn't just
stop watching paul no no no like
trying to stop cold turkey is almost
impossible right because you're going to
be successful at it for a while and
eventually you're going to relapse and
start over and feel bad but
no what i did was i simply postponed my
meat beat sessions two before bed so i
have my daily routine
you guys know i'm big on having a daily
routine i had my daily routine and i
wasn't allowed to be my meat or wash
pawn
unless i was done with completing my day
routine so going to the gym
making my meals going to school you know
just doing [ __ ]
at the end of the day i rewarded myself
by either clapping cheeks with a booty
call them
all my ex at the time or beating my meat
because it's not every time
my guys went out that we actually came
back with girls right sometimes we just
went out and came back nothing so
hey [ __ ] it beating my me tonight right
but i made sure
to never ever ever ever uh watch
to beat my maid in the morning even
today even to this day even with my girl
i don't have sex in the morning because
my polar thing goes up and then i don't
want to do [ __ ] for the rest of the day
so i have a strict rule you guys my girl
i do not have sex in the morning because
that [ __ ]
[ __ ] me up for the rest of the day i
wait till my daily routine is over
so i accomplish my goals for the day and
boom see you in the room tell me clap
your treats so that's what i recommend
to you guys
first have a daily routine i have a goal
right because what's the point of having
your dopamine and your testosterone high
if you're not going to be productive
right so have a go have a daily routine
and then you can either just do nofap
right quite cold turkey or
you could just make sure that you
postpone it to uh only at the end of the
day
when you completed your offer [ __ ] all
right so hopes that answers all the
questions i get about another five no
five no five semen retention blah blah
blah right
it's all about keeping your dopamine and
your testosterone levels up
and in the future i'm gonna make another
video about video games because really
people think no fap is the issue people
think porn is the issue
[ __ ] no video games are the issue and
that's coming from somebody who used to
be addicted to video games
like there's a lot of guys that say oh
i'm doing no five watch me i'm doing no
five yeah and then they go and play
video games for eight hours like what's
the [ __ ] point you're not being
productive
but that's a topic for a whole different
video anyway comment below let me know

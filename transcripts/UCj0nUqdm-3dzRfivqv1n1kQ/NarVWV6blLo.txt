hey guys what's going on megan here back
with another video
of today's tuesday so top 10 tuesday and
i decided to go back to the roots right
back to some bodybuilding content you
guys know i'm a huge huge bodybuilding
fan
ever since i was a [ __ ] little kid so
um
back to the mr olympic content for
today's tale it's tuesday it's going to
be
every single mr olympia ranked um
according to my uh
taylor's categories you know from i'm
about to nut which is the highest
s tier to pure garbage right now keep in
mind guys i have
i have a bias if you know me i'm biased
towards mass monsters
remember i started getting into
bodybuilding um
i mean i started getting interested into
bible when i was a kid because of dragon
ball z right
mainly because of brawley super vegeta
all these huge ass
buff dudes right so i don't give a [ __ ]
about the super lean physiques the frank
zane type of physics
i'm all about mass muscles uh physiques
that are just
just genetic freaks things that we will
never achieve naturally all right
so don't get butt hurt if you see your
favorite bodybuilder rank lower
it's not my fault he wasn't a mass
[ __ ] monster now keep in mind guys
it's not really fair to compare them
because
different eras different um um drug
regimens things like that come into play
and also you know people were looking
for different things back then but
we're gonna try our best to uh we're
just gonna pretend like they were all
in the same era [ __ ] it just to keep it
simple all right let's go
uh samir ah i'm gonna put samir
uh to be honest man
i wanna put samir bad guys yeah i know i
know i know
don't get me wrong amazing physique but
you know for my preferences again he
wasn't really a mass monster but i give
him credit though
it's because of samir that the back
developments
started getting crazy in you know on the
olympia stage
people think it was because of lee haney
and dorian's no he was really sameer
lee haney had to pretty much um compete
with samir bino's back development you
know and that's what gave us
lee haney dorian yes and eventually
ronnie so i give him props for that but
as far as his physique
it's not something i look at and i'm
like god damn he looks you know he looks
broadly [ __ ] no
uh next let's look at franco colombo i'm
gonna put him out okay right he wasn't
really a mass muscle but he was
[ __ ] huge for his height guys [ __ ]
huge
um and and god damn that [ __ ] chest
man
everyone thinks that arnold when they
think of chess development but people
sleep on
[ __ ] franco uh next um
i'm gonna put chris chris i wanna put
chris that bad man again he was
aesthetic don't get me wrong
um because that's what people were
looking for back then but
nowhere near mass monster type
development in fact i know some natty
guys who can pretty much look like chris
next you have the original i'm gonna put
larry
at was gonna put him at pure garbage but
it's gonna piss off so many people but
[ __ ] it you know this is team three
alpha we don't give a [ __ ] what people
think right
i'm gonna put him at pure garbage right
and keep in mind guys this is this is
not against
the you know this nothing personal
against the bodybuilders obviously
he you know he's the first olympian so
all respect
uh this list is objective it's about the
physiques
that i find mind-boggling right and i'm
gonna put him down here i'm sorry
there's some natties today who
who look i'm not gonna say better but
you know and again you know i can't
really blame him because that was back
in the early [ __ ] days of
bodybuilding
but still like i don't look at larry
scott and think oh my god you know this
physique blows me out of what no
it's just yeah he looks big he looks
impressive but like i said he wasn't
using the same amount of uh
he wasn't on the same regimen as those
guys right as far as steroid usage so
um genetic was also but anyway so next
we have oh god damn it man this thing
doesn't show his face but
you guys know who this is you could tell
just by looking at his body sergio
guys i'm gonna put sergio at okay
right now don't get me wrong i should
put him in front of uh
franco because his physique i still
think to this day i'm gonna make a
separate video about that but i still
think to stay there
sergio probably has the best genetics
ever in bodybuilding it's just
his error you know um uh the the
knowledge of bodybuilding and uh
you know and steroid usage was not was
not as good as it is today you know
especially the 90s the 2000s whatever um
if he was on everything people are
taking these days oh my god i honestly
think he'll have a better physique than
ronnie coleman
you know if he was on the same regiment
but i'm pretty sure he was just on the
basics you know excuse me
so i'm gonna put him out okay um but
again
amazing physique and he definitely would
have been higher
if he was uh um in today's era all right
next we have arnold
you guys know a big fan of all know i'm
gonna put all note at
i'm kind of biased because again growing
up man i love the terminator one of my
favorite movies of all time and you know
you know you guys know if you grew up in
a i was born in 89 so if you're a 90s
baby you loved arnold right
he was in you know almost every movie
uh but i'm gonna put him [ __ ] man
i'm gonna put him out okay yeah i'm
sorry guys put him out okay
um mainly because of his uh in fact the
reason why he's so high
right is of course that [ __ ] chest
that barrel [ __ ] chest man but really
the reason i'm not putting him higher is
because let's be honest guys
arnold had no legs um again it wasn't a
huge requirement back then
[ __ ] i think i got covered guys i'm just
playing
um he had no legs uh his shoulders were
all right right
zero traps you guys know i'm a [ __ ]
sucker when it comes to traps right
if you have big traps you get you get
ranked so high on my list even if you
have nothing else right
you can have no legs no arms no nothing
you have monster traps upper and mid
traps i'm ranking you higher and
although it had
[ __ ] traps man i'm sorry relative to
obviously
uh the other guys there he was mainly
you know
chest and biceps even his triceps are
trash so sorry arnold love you but
you're going to be at okay
uh dexter jackson again he
if you like symmetry and aesthetics he
will be at i'm about to not category
right
but again this is not just symmetry and
and you know static this is mass
monsters
so again i'm gonna put him at
[ __ ] this is tough because he has some
[ __ ] sick tracks but the thing about
dexter jackson straps is
they only stick out when he's doing the
most muscular when he's just standing
relaxed he looks like he has no traps
but when he does the most muscular
shit's [ __ ] pop out
um but anyway this is not a trap
solution this is uh let's see you're
ranking him by mass monsters ah man this
is tough
i want to put him out okay but his
physique blows all these guys out of the
water
i want to put in my [ __ ] amazing but
that's so close to
i'm about to not category i'm gonna put
in my [ __ ] amazing right
[ __ ] it i'm gonna put my [ __ ] amazing
simply because uh
when he comes on stage he's uh you know
he's a physique that you know doesn't
blow me away but it's pretty impressive
but of course when he comes in heavier
he loses conditioning which is the main
thing he was known for
all right next up um frank said guys you
guys gonna hate me for this but
pure garbage man i'm sorry i'm sorry i
know people love the frank zane physique
i despise that look man i despise it
like i like mass monsters my first one
he has
zero and i mean zero [ __ ] traps um
his legs are defined but obviously you
know small as hell and i get it like i
said it was the error back then but
i don't know man it's kind of like my
friends who love spiderman and i'm kind
of like a venom guy
again back to the whole mass monster
thing i don't like that lean
skinny physique man i [ __ ] i just
don't man
and i keep in mind he's bigger than
almost you know every natural guy out
there but
uh relative to those guys i'm putting
him down i do not like the franklin
physique i'm sorry
frank zane gray guy but physique as no
next
lee [ __ ] haney the original goat
the reason why we have ronnie coleman
and dorian yates
i'm gonna put in my [ __ ] amazing i
love
lee haney's back man get the [ __ ] ahead
there you go i'm gonna put him in front
of that collection i love not keep in
mind his legs were trash but
again you know error to error right um
i love his [ __ ] back development his
traps weren't saying his upper traps
were not ridiculous but just
from the back insane mid traps he's the
reason why we have ronnie i mean
well we have uh dorian yates right he uh
shooting because durian had to come in
and compete with this back
insane back development great biceps
suit next brandon curry
to be honest i was surprised when he won
the olympia because
you know brandon ray was out for a long
time he was around for a long [ __ ]
time he just never plays high
and he just transformed turned into a
straight beast i want to put him at
[ __ ] amazing because again you know
not really a mass monster but definitely
more impressive than these physiques
down here
sean wrote it i'm gonna put it that bad
i'm sorry guys again i don't like that
[ __ ]
super aesthetic super small physique no
don't get me wrong he wasn't small he
wasn't [ __ ] you know i mean he has
some size on him but
again he went back towards that classic
again that frank zane look
um and i get like i said it's pleasing
to the eye but to me it's not impressive
you know it's not something i see and i
go holy [ __ ] you look like brawley
android 13
type of [ __ ] so i'm gonna put him down
here big
[ __ ] rammy you guys already know i'm
putting big grammy in the [ __ ]
amazing category
mass monster for days i mean he's dealts
his quads come on guys like when bigger
he won the olympia this year i was so
[ __ ] pumped well i shouldn't say this
[ __ ] cause it was 20 20 but you know
what the [ __ ] i mean
i was so [ __ ] pumped i was like yes
back to the mass monster days because
with him being misolympia now everyone
is gonna have to come on stage
at least at least five to ten pounds
bigger
right elsie just dwarfs everybody um so
yeah definitely let's let's bring back
the mass monsters
everybody else go to [ __ ] physique
right don't pollute open bodybuilding
open bodybuilding should be for the mass
monsters
period next oh my god
i'm about to [ __ ] not guys you guys
already know
one of my top 10 favorite bodybuilders
of all time thorian
[ __ ] yates the [ __ ] shadow
mass monster galore insane back
development
insane trap development upper traps not
as beefy as i want him but his
mid his mid traps and his lower traps
get the [ __ ] out of here guys
i'm about to not for days now let me
everyone he has some weaknesses
especially after the injuries his biceps
and things like that
um but his back right triceps were
decent calves were [ __ ] massive
um great forearms uh he actually sucked
at everything else to be honest you know
his abs were not amazing his biceps were
not amazing
even his shoulders were trash um and
obviously his squads
were also trashed by his conditioning
his lats
his back development come on guys i'm
about to nut
for days um jake cutler yes guys
[ __ ] amazing i was a huge huge jay
cutler fan
um back in the early 2000's hugely
colorful mainly because of his
[ __ ] shoulders you know everyone
talks about his lats and you know his
quads
but everyone forgets he had boulder i
mean boulder [ __ ] shoulders standing
next to ronnie coleman
insane insane and again ronnie brought
him up to that you know he had to
compete with ronnie you know he had to
come in massive
in fact i want to put him i mean i'm
about to not category but i just don't
like putting a lot of guys up there you
know
next we have uh phil heath again phil
heath i'm going to put him right here
[ __ ] amazing
right um keep in mind the reason i'm
putting drake out here is because he
dwarfs everybody else
right so in fact if you want to rank
these guys according to [ __ ] amazing
um
he will definitely be here it will be
something like this
there you go and i almost want to put
larry scott higher just because i hate
frank zayn's physique so much
but yeah so uh phil heath here again
great physique round i mean
again he was like a better more improved
version of kevin levrone which
i'm so sad that he never want to know on
the left here because i love kevin
you guys know that um but yeah so phil
heath amazing physique
um but i just wish he had came in you
know i just wish he came in bigger
again it's not really focused he had a
small frame but [ __ ] it last

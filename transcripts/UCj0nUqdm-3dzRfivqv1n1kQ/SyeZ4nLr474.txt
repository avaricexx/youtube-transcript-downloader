hey guys going on megan here top five
ways to boost testosterone naturally i
get this question
so much and i've covered it in the past
but hey
uh i promise to make a video on
testosterone at least once a week
ideally thursday starts on thursday so
might as well answer that question all
right so i'm going to skip the details
but now you should already know
all the benefits of testosterone like i
just went over them you should also know
the pathway
very important slush in your brain down
to your balls and then your body
converts collections into testosterone
obviously i'm skipping a million steps
but
trying to make this video short now why
is it why is it important to know the
pathway before you even try to boost
your levels naturally
simple right you want to know where the
issue is coming from if you have
chronically low t
is it an issue with the brain right your
hypothalamus or your pituitary gland
not producing hormones right or is it an
issue with your bowels
90 of the time is going to be between
this axis here
and then the other 10 percent is going
to be related to uh two other factors
by the way let's look at the top five
fastest ways no gimmick no [ __ ]
no marketing bs the top five most
effective and most efficient ways to
boost your levels
unless those five things are taken care
of don't even try to look for anything
else
number one is obviously sleep right i
beat a dead horse over this in almost
every video
guys you cannot message me or email me
and
complain about your tea levels being so
low if you're not getting enough sleep
there's just no way around it
right almost all of your testosterone
production right if you're 90
so around seven milligrams a day are
being produced
at night look at the time here right so
during the day you're not you're not
really producing a lot of testosterone
in fact your t-levels decline
during the day that's why when you're
measuring your t levels uh the doctors
ask you to
collect your sample in the morning right
because that's when you see that was
actually the highest
throughout the day your t levels
actually decline right so the majority
of your
testosterone is produced while you sleep
guys
and a lot of you guys are playing
fortnite or watching netflix
partying whatever and then you wonder
why your tea levels are getting crushed
right get good nicely watch my videos on
sleep right it goes beyond testosterone
right
especially if you're trying to put on
muscle uh but yeah so that's the number
one thing right
stop looking for the complicated new
complex way
uh to fix your issues when the basics
are not taken care of
right get your sleeping and here's the
show that i saw in the previous video
where
if you look at the correlation between
the amount of time spent sleeping and
the testosterone levels you can clearly
see the correlation right
those who get the most sleep are gonna
have uh the higher testosterone levels
and those will sleep less
obviously gonna have less tea you know
again it's just common sense right
it's produced at night second thing
calories
you gotta eat again watch my video on
why
uh chasing six-pack abs is killing
natty's if you're natural
you cannot be in a deficit constantly
right and if you're obese and you're
trying to lose weight then you don't
really have a [ __ ] choice right
uh but for those of you guys who are
already fairly lean or who are in a
healthy body fat percentage range
constantly being a deficit is not going
to optimize your t levels
and it's simple right it goes all the
way back to the hypothalamus goes back
to your brain
your brain is always trying to decide
what to invest in
the priority is always survival right
it's survival
or reproduction those are the two things
that your brain is always trying to
figure out hey where should i put most
of my money in right
money being you know atp energy calories
whatever right
so if your survival is threatened the
last thing your brain cares about is
reproduction right
when your survival is threatened your
body tries to put as much energy as
possible
towards survival right so if you're in a
caloric deficit guess what
your survival is threatened you know you
got a thing in terms of evolution right
so your body tries to shut down all the
things that increase your metabolic rate
right so testosterone t3 your body slows
down their production
and tries to conserve as much energy as
possible right so the last thing your
body wants is a ton of muscle mass
or a very high sex drive that's why when
people go on you know these crazy diets
to try to get shredded for shows
what do they all report their
testosterone levels plummet
that sex drive goes through [ __ ] they
don't want to they don't want to [ __ ]
that girl they don't want to clap cheeks
they don't want to do nothing
right because now your brain is focusing
on survival so it shuts
down to stop some production right not
completely obviously not to zero
but you get a drastic reduction same
thing with women right when i have
female clients that are trying to get
super lean for shows
i can't tell them no because obviously
you know that's the goal
but i want them and sure enough the sex
drive goes down
a lot of them even lose their periods so
it's the same thing for men and women
for them it's mainly estrogen but same
concept so
you can't always be in a deficit guys
now like i said if you're obese
then yeah you don't really have a choice
right you might have to go in deficit um
and eventually your t levels might even
go up you know essentially burning away
so much fat
and you're ending up with less aromatase
so don't complain about your tea levels
being too low if you're eating 1500
calories a day
next stress this is the third biggest
important factor
back to the synthesis of testosterone it
starts with cholesterol
in your testes obviously yes converters
bring that alone
dhea progesterone and then eventually
you get androstenity all right
and we'll stop here right because
eventually the chain keeps going you
know testosterone covers the dht
or estrogen blah blah but we'll stop
here since this video is about to start
so
now when you're under a ton of [ __ ]
stress when you're constantly stressed
out
i don't care if it's work related or you
know
family drama or anything that's chronic
anything that's constantly stressing you
out
it goes back to what i mentioned in the
previous video right your body wants to
now focus on survival
as opposed to reproduction so your body
takes progesterone which is obviously
needed to make testosterone
and your body eventually turns that [ __ ]
into cortisol which is the troll of the
human body you know literally like if
out of all the hormones the biggest
stroll is cortisol because it does the
exact opposite of testosterone the
decrease in myostatin you get from
testosterone nope
that's reverse now your body increases
my statin it starts [ __ ] up your
gains
uh the decrease in fat storage that's
reversed
right so now your body starts storing
fat like crazy the increase in
metabolism you get from testosterone
nope
and your body's metabolism t3 is
converted to reverse t3
slows down your metabolism blah blah
blah pretty much all the benefits
that testosterone gives flip them and
you have cortisol
right it's the biggest [ __ ] control
of the human body for the purpose of
maximizing muscle growth
and minimizing fat gain you don't want
cortisol elevated
like i said on the acute spike it's fine
but chronic elevational cortisol
is a disaster so manage stress if you
constantly stress that
even if it's even if your testosterone
levels are in a healthy range
if you're constantly stressed out your
testosterone the cortisol ratio is going
to be [ __ ] up right
so all that testosterone is not really
going to mean much remember it's not
just about the stats and it's also about
having
uh free testosterone and having
testosterone's effects uh non-negated by
cortisol
you know they compete for a lot of
things in the human body you know even
binding side some dna
so manage stress try to lower stress as
much as possible
uh like i said a lot of things help you
know um comedy helps a lot you know when
you're very stressed like it's what
watching funny videos
that helps meditation um sleeping right
sleeping is one way to deal with stress
next the fourth most important thing uh
when it comes to testosterone
is fats right you gotta have fats in
your diet you know
healthy fats of course um and that
includes saturated fats
because saturated fats are being
demonized for so long um and people are
finally starting to realize that no it's
not the enemy
um but yeah you need fasting diet
remember testosterone is made from
cholesterol now yes your body makes its
own cholesterol but guess what
um it's also used for other purposes
right your liver makes cholesterol many
other purposes other than just
testosterone production
so you gotta have fats in your diet and
see here the correlation between the
amount of fat in your diet pretty much
the amount of calories that come from
fats
and your testosterone is very linear and
you can see here the r square is 51
right point 51 which is pretty high
right means
over half of the variance in
testosterone levels can be explained
just by fat
intake right which is crazy and here we
saturate the fat as point 59
which is an r value of about 0.76 so
long story short
get your fats in right that's another
reason why when people go on
these crazy diets uh the testosterone
levels also drop is because
when you cut your calories to low what's
one of the first macros that people cut
is fats right since obviously fat has
more than double the calories of
protein and carbs so when people are
dieting that's why the tea levels get
crushed oil they're cutting the calories
and they're cutting their fat intake
right
on top of all the stress that comes with
that so don't neglect your fats
and last but not least vitamins and
minerals you got to fix
any vitamin deficiencies and mineral
deficiencies that you have
that you currently have and you'd be
surprised almost everyone almost
everyone i talk to is deficient in one
of the key vitamins and minerals now for
testosterone there's a whole list of
them but again this video i'm focusing
on the top five
vitamin d watch my video on vitamin d
which is pretty much not a vitamin it's
a hormone it's in fact
more important than testosterone for
your body but anyway
people have deficient vitamin d because
nobody gets sunlight anymore no one eats
enough fish or
vitamin d fortified foods and um
people who do supplement with vitamin d
don't even take enough ius
right so vitamin d make sure you
increase that either through sunlight or
supplementation or diet
magnesium almost everybody's not getting
enough magnesium especially if you train
zinc everyone should know this by now
right zinc is one of the most important
minerals for testosterone
and finally vitamin c vitamin a these
are the top five right the top five
most important vitamins and minerals uh
for testosterone production there's
obviously more you have selenium your
boron blah blah blah
but i'm trying to keep this video short
and simple just the top five
so if your diet is not high in fruits
and vegetables
fix that uh or consider supplementing
all right that's it guys those are the
top five ways to maximize testosterone
production naturally i
highly recommend you focus on those top
five before you even look into anything
else
now again they're not the only ways
they're just the top five most important
right i'm gonna make videos on the other
uh method as well obviously training
fasting sprinting
you know heavy compound movements blah
blah all this all these things we
already know about but they're not the
top five most important

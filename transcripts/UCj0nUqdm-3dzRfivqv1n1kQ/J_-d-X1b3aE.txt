cold shower or cold exposure the
researchers makes some studies show a
decrease in testosterone some studies
show an increase in testosterone but
that's because that's influenced by so
many different factors but in the ones
that do show an increase in testosterone
is usually visible within minutes right
so whether you're icing your balls or
whether you doing cold immersion or
doing a cold shower as long as the
temperature is low enough you will get
an increase in testosterone mainly
through the catac colomine pathway right
so no epinephrine no adrenaline same
molecule depending on where you live at
next

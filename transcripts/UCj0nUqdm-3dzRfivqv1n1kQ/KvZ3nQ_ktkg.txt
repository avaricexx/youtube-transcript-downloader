hey guys what's up just a random clip me
doing face pools if you're not doing
these I suggest you add them to your
routine they are great for upper back
midback thickness R boys real death all
that good look at that so try them
out do them either before your routine
or after your back routine especially
after your deadlifts and stuff like that
to complete the tie and uh your upper
back I think the upper back is sexiest
muscle on on the male body so uh I'm
just biased but anyway try it out just a
random clip peace PE

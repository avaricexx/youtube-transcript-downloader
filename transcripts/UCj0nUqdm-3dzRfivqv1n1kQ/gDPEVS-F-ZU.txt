hey guys what's going on megan here
check out
check out this guy this freak of nature
absolute [ __ ] unit i mean if i didn't
know any better i would think these
pictures will photoshop
and keep in mind this is not a
bodybuilder anyway this is another
episode of what the [ __ ] wednesday where
we just talk about how genetic freaks
people who are
hyper responders to pds there's people
who have impressive physiques or body
parts
and on the last episode i got a request
to go over
this absolute tank here so let's find
out a little bit more about his stats
his name is revised i'm not going to try
to
pronounce his name but i'm guessing it's
pronounced
nada rashville um he's five foot nine
five four eight five four nine he weighs
about
215 pounds well at least he competed in
a 98 kg category recently
and he's from georgia right a lot of
[ __ ] phenoms
and beasts come from that region right
very very powerful ancestry
a lot of warriors from there and as you
can tell
he's an olympic wrestler greco-roman
wrestling not
wwe type [ __ ] and yes i know what
everyone is going to say
god who's on roy's on royals first of
all start preaching to the choir okay
but not everyone who takes royce looks
like this you guys
are clueless about how the body works
right you can take all the drugs in the
world
99 chance you want to achieve this look
this guy is a genetic
[ __ ] freak you can tell even when he
was a lot younger look at his frame look
at his
development for his age no matter what
he was on
by anyway one of the muscles that stands
out is obviously straps you guys know
i'm obsessed
with [ __ ] traps i still think to this
day that it's the most alpha
badass muscle in the human body i would
sacrifice all my gains
just to have massive traps right look at
this all the way up to his [ __ ] neck
right and establishing not just from the
high energy and receptor content he
actually
uses his traps a lot in his profession
right that's the reason why strongman
competitors
tend to have massive traps they're
always lifting heavy [ __ ] off the ground
you know
when they're lifting stones when they're
doing former walks
uh same thing with olympic weightlifting
right they're always doing power clean
snatch pools high pools that lives
every day is trap state right same thing
for bodybuilders who have power lifting
backgrounds right where they're very
used to doing a lot of heavy deadlifts
they tend to have these over developed
traps compared to their peers who are
also on antibiotic steroids
and just to show you guys someone
photoshop ronnie coming with our tribes
so you could clearly see how much traps
make your physique so much more
impressive
look at this [ __ ] here he looks like
jobs or banks but anyway so
obviously he makes really really really
good use of his traps
for those who've never seen his clips
they are [ __ ] hilarious look this is
all he does like
obviously you know he has a lot of
technical skills but a lot of what he's
known for is just
picking [ __ ] off the ground and
just
slamming them suplex city right this
[ __ ] is so funny to me every time i see
this i can't stop laughing like this
guy's like put me down put me down you
know he's on roy
he's like shut up boom i [ __ ]
love this [ __ ] guys suplex city slamming
[ __ ] like looking like a fish
out of water look at this guy just
flapping his hands but yeah very very
powerful guy
look at this [ __ ] he's literally about
to send this guy to the shadow room
another picture by the way i'm getting
all this pictures mainly from his
instagram so definitely go check him out
uh he has a lot more stuff on there i
wish he was more popular you know
really impressive physique i mean there
goes him stan
who allowed this match to even happen
look at him standing next to his
competitor
like who even allowed this match to go
through you know what i mean like
look at this size difference you know
now how does he pass the test i have no
[ __ ] clue maybe he's really good
at uh [ __ ] cycling on and off
uh but like i said it's definitely
combined with amazing genetics he
probably has the my stand efficiency
somewhere or
it's probably over producing father
style who knows there goes another shot
here look at his bicep
even his quads you know look at the leg
difference obviously it's a different
angle but look at the leg they're french
guys
and there goes him standing next to
someone who's actually pretty good shape
but
look at the difference dwarfing
[ __ ]
these guys from georgia man another
powerful shot here
even his arm development triceps
shoulders
really well developed for olympic
wrestler
there was another shot look at his
forearms massive phones but man i can't
stop looking at those [ __ ] traps
traps of peace
another shot here i mean can you imagine
you walk out
of a bar of the gym and this guy just
walks up to you and he's like yo give me
your protein shake like you can't
not say yes
[ __ ] animal and i'm glad he kept the
beard you know
the bear gives you like plus 15 extra
alpha points
on your rpg stats another shot here
traps up to his neck lighting from the
gods
and it's funny how he actually has the
perfect um wrestling phenotype right
that perfect anatomy for wrestlers which
is
very very low center of gravity short
legs short arms
really good for wrestling but anyway
guys definitely check out his instagram

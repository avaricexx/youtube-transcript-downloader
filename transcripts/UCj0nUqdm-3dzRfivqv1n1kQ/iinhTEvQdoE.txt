hey guys going on megan here best biceps
exercises of all time
watch the previous videos if you haven't
covered chest
back traps uh triceps and i believe
shoulders
um but anyway best biceps exercises of
all time
i'm only picking the top 15 right
because
there's a million bags of exercises out
there so i want to keep it simple focus
on the top 15
and remember the criteria is basically
if you could only pick
one exercise for the rest of your life
what would it be right so that's the
criteria i'm using here because it's
very hard to find
a bad uh biceps exercise right because
the biceps are very simple muscle right
it only has two functions to flex the
arm and obviously supinate the arm so
most biceps exercises do that right so
it's very hard to
um to find a horrible biceps exercise
all right let's get to it remember guys
the five categories are the same you
have my box of nut which is
best are the best you have [ __ ]
amazing you have okay which is pretty
much neutral
you have bad and you have pure garbage
now for an exercise to make it at the
top
it has to not only put maximum tension
on the bicep which is pretty much the
goal of any exercise right you're trying
to use maximum tension
um so you could recruit as many motor
units and muscle fibers as possible
but the exercise also has to try to hit
two birds with one stone right it has to
try to do both functions of the bicep
so let's see i'm going to pick them at
random you have concentration curls
right
arnold style i'm going to put that one
at
hmm i see this is tough because it's
actually pretty good exercise
i'm going to put that one that [ __ ]
amazing right only
and i repeat only if you supinate your
arm
right if you rotate your wrist at the
top of the movement
if not then it's gonna go down two okay
so a really good exercise
also remember this is not based on hsp
right on my program because obviously
depending on the day you're going to
have to pick a different exercise right
on your age day you focus on only on
heavy movements
so that's going to change the criteria
completely on your estate which is
stretch day you're focusing on the
eccentric
and you focus on getting a maximum
stretch training the muscle
in a lengthened stretch position so
that's also going to change
um which exercise is going to be number
one and finally on
p day which is your pump day you're
mainly trying to get a maximum pump
right so that's only gonna
so that's obviously gonna eliminate a
lot of the good exercises
that are perfect for h s right so it's
all relative it depends on your goal
so for the sake of this video we're just
going to look at all the exercises
regardless of whether you're doing hsp
training or not
all right so [ __ ] amazing next you
have the preacher curl believe it or not
i'm going to put that when i'm about to
not why well one you're putting maximum
tension on the bicep
right you're sitting down you're in a
locked position so you can't really
cheat a lot
right there's no momentum coming in from
your hips or your front delts so it
really puts all of the tension
on your bicep and most importantly
you get to supinate and you know pretty
much rotate your wrist at the top of the
movement
so you get to perform both functions of
the bicep in one exercise
next you have the hammer curl that's
another exercise that i'm going to put
in i'm about in that category
and this one is mainly for a different
reason right the reason i'm putting this
one that high is because
most people have very under trained
brachialis that's right from the front
a lot of people look like they don't
have biceps at all right mainly because
their brachialis is under develop right
so
hammer curls are going to fix that not
only it's going to help you recruit your
biceps but it's obviously going to hit
your brachialis as well
and you can obviously go a lot heavier
on this lift
now i actually recommend that you do it
sitting down so that you can put maximum
attention on the biceps
if you're standing trust me your hips
are going to
come into play your front delts are
going to come into play
and you're going to take tension away
from the biceps so seated
hammer girls great great great exercise
for overall arm development including
like i said your biceps your brachialis
and a little bit of your forearms
next you have the preacher girls i'm
gonna put that one out [ __ ] amazing
the only reason it's not higher is like
i said because you cannot
supinate your wrist but if you're doing
a dumbbell version right
you can definitely put it higher it's
pretty much if you're doing a dumbbell
version it's pretty much uh
you know preacher girl next you have the
standing bubble curve which is pretty
much the king of bicep exercises i'm
going to put that one at [ __ ] amazing
the reason i'm not putting it higher is
you already guessed it if you're using
the barbell
uh one you're gonna use a lot of
momentum right which is fine
uh if you're doing each day of hsp
training but if you're just doing a
uh if you're just trying to put maximum
tension on the muscle you know you're
not focusing on power or strength
whatever you're just trying to put
maximum attention on the muscle uh i'm
not gonna put it at number one
right uh again it's not okay or bad
right it's still that [ __ ] amazing
but for the sake of maximum tension
i can't put it higher because i see too
many people butcher this exercise right
they use way too much momentum uh way
too much
lag drive front delts you name it
so great exercise great mass builder
but people tend to use too much momentum
and it does not
allow you to supinate your wrist
now this one which is the exact same
exercise but using dumbbells so the
standing
alternating dumbbell occur is in i'm
about to not category why because it's
just above a curl
but much better right whether you're
doing
standing or seated again i always
recommend seated for maximum tension
but it allows you to rotate your wrist
at the top
so it's pretty much the barbell curl
upgraded
plus it allows you to fix imbalances
right because if you're doing a bubble
curl and you have
muscle imbalances let's say one arm is
strong on any other
well you're not really going to fix it
you know with this exercise
because the stronger arm is always going
to have uh
um it's always going to contribute more
to the exercise than the week off
next you have the higher pulley curl i'm
going to put that one out okay right
it's a great exercise
on your on the p day of hsp training so
if you're just trying to get a maximum
pump
very few exercises compared to this one
really really really good
you get a really good contraction um but
if i could only pick one exercise for
the rest of my life
it will not be this one right so that's
the only reason why i'm putting it here
but it's still a very very good exercise
remember
all of these exercises are amazing right
but i have to make the criteria very
very strict
else everything is going to be up here
next you have the
incline curl i'm gonna put that one at
i'm about to not and i'm gonna tell you
guys why
one it's a very underrated exercise a
lot of people don't do it so that bicep
is actually very weak in that
um in that angle two
you can supinate your wrist at the top
three
there's no momentum involved right
you're sitting in a chair you can't
really cheat
can't use too much front delts can't use
lag and hip drive
so it puts a lot of tension on your
biceps and obviously it's a
very great exercise for uh the ass stay
on your stretch day when you're trying
to get a maximum stretch and you're
trying to focus on the negative
very few exercises beat that one and you
have the cable version so i'm gonna put
that one at amazing
simply because i you know again you're
standing so a lot of the tension is
going to be
divided across whatever muscle you use
achieve
next you have the basic rope hammer curl
again i'm going to put this one out okay
i think it's a very overrated exercise
um it's yes it's you you're doing a
hammer version but the fact that you're
standing
you know takes a lot of attention away
from the biceps unless you're really
really straight with your phone which
most people are not right
now if you rotate your wrist at the top
then it's going to go a bit higher
right next you obviously have the chin
up believe it or not this is a great
exercise for biceps you know the energy
activation of your biceps is actually
very very high when you're doing uh chin
ups again underhand
but i'm gonna put that one out okay
right because you know it's not
if i could only pick one exercise for
biceps it would not be simply because
the tension
is spread out you know your lats are
coming in your mid back depending on how
you know how
how bad your arc is so it's not going to
be my go-to exercise
for biceps next you have the standing
cable curl again i'm going to put that
one
at so i'm gonna put that one out okay
right because again you're standing
so you know there's gonna be some
cheating involved unless your form is
really really good and you're very
strict
and you leave your ego at the door um
and it does not allow you to rotate your
wrist at the top so
you know i can't put it at i'm about to
another [ __ ] amazing
now yes the barber version you can't
rotate your wrist
but you can go a lot heavier as you
progress over time right so that kind of
you know neutralizes some of the bad
things about the exercise
next show the spider curl [ __ ]
amazing very very very very good
exercise
uh like i said a lot of the momentum is
sticking out if you notice any exercise
where
you're not gonna you know your ego is
not gonna get in the way you're not
going to use too much momentum you're
not going to cheat too much
i'm always going to rank it high simply
because that's the goal you're trying to
put attention on the muscle right that's
why
i have so many videos year after year
ranting about
people that over that over emphasize
strength too much right because when you
over emphasize strength
you forget about the goal of
bodybuilding right you forget about
you know the fact that you're trying to
put tension on the muscle
right anyone can go out there and use
momentum and leverage techniques
and just increase their numbers every
single week but that's why a lot of
these [ __ ] just don't grow at all
right because the tension is not placed
on the muscle most of the time oh
anything that lacks you in place
anything that stops you from cheating
too much i'm always gonna rank it high
and a spider girl you know fits that
criteria now of course you can't
supinate your race so that's why i'm not
putting it higher
you know but if you're using dumbbells
you know that problem is dealt with
next you have the man it's another
exercise that i can't stand it's not a
bad exercise guys it's not a bad
exercise like i said as long as you
doing what the bicep is supposed to do
the exercise works you're going to get
results from it but i just don't like
when people over complicate things right
so this one i don't know what's the
[ __ ] name
right the reverse skull crusher lying on
your back curl to your face whatever
[ __ ] aim it has but it's a good
exercise again like i said it allows you
to
um uh flex your arm but i'm gonna put it
out okay
right now if you're trying to focus on
if it's your pump day right so if you're
doing hsp and it's your pump day or if
you're using the bro split version of
hsp training so
you're doing at the end of your workout
then great right because you're going to
get a maximum pump
um and you can't really cheat too much
because you're lying down that's the
only reason why i'm not putting it
at bad right is because you know it it
removes the momentum
you're lying down but i'm not putting
hard because it's just
it's not practical right right let's not
complicate things
you can do the exact same thing with the
high pulley version so i'm gonna put it
out okay
and it's the only one i'm gonna put at
pure garbage right the reverse
barbell curl it's a good exercise if
you're training forearms you know you'll
break your radialis
on and so forth but it's not optimal if
you're just trying to focus on biceps
right pronating your wrist puts your
biceps in a very weak position
so you're not going to recruit maximum
muscle fibers
as far as biceps are concerned right
which is the goal of this video now if
this video was about
four ohms only or brachialis only sure
but as far as biceps go i'm gonna put
that one at pure garbage
so that's the list guys there goes your
best of the best exercises as long as
you rotate your wrist
at the top you have the [ __ ] amazing
squad
you have the okay squad and like i said
earlier in the video it's very hard to
find a very bad basketball exercise
because they all do the [ __ ] same
thing right it's all about
elbow flexion primarily but anyway hope
this video helps
comment below and let me know what you
want the next list to be on
the next tailless video it doesn't have
to be bodybuilding related it could be
anything any topic

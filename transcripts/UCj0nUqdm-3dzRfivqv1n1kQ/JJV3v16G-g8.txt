and trust me if you squeeze at the
bottom and hold that contraction you
gonna get a stupid pump
hey guys what's going on begin here all
right so let's answer the next question
on the reddit right so best chess
construction exercises i like that he
posted a stats remember guys whenever
you post a question in the reddit uh
when whenever you're asking for feedback
always always include your top five
stats right look at rule number two
and it's gonna pretty much show you
which stats to include all right so i
already answered this question ready so
time for the video version of it uh
let's see 510 155
19 year old male
my chest hasn't developed in size in the
last year and i've been consistently
lifting for 15 months first muscle that
grew when i started doing resistance
training was my chest due to the
push-ups but now pushers don't exhaust
my chest at all yeah that's a common
problem
um because you have to keep doing higher
and higher reps as your body you know
adapts to it and eventually you just you
know wasting time right because
you have to do like 50 reps uh
you know close to fairly before you even
get
full motor unit recruitment but anyway
no does benching with barbell dumbbells
benching is only felt on my shoulders
maybe because you're not arcing your
back unless i see a video it's tough to
make a judgment number flies don't work
either yeah dumber flies are not mainly
for uh
they're not a chest contraction
exercises so to speak right mainly for
like a way to stretch
um you know to train the the chest in a
stretch position
i haven't felt the solid contraction in
my packs in more than a year
maybe no it's not your skeletal
structure trust me now yeah so the best
exercises and i already answered it down
here right cable flies are the goat
of maximum pack contraction exercises
just squeeze for three seconds at the
end of the century time you get a stupid
pump right so long story short nothing
and i mean nothing if you're trying to
work on mind muscle connection you're
trying to learn how to maximally
contract and recruit your chest
nothing beats cable flies
right bent over cable flies right just
find one of these basic ass machines
right you know
where most people do crossovers bend
your ass over yes or mo and then squeeze
at the bottom just put a slight
bend in your elbows and keep that band
the whole time right and then squeeze at
the bottom make sure that you retract
your scapula so that your front dots
don't take over
um and trust me if you squeeze at the
bottom and hold that contraction
you gonna get a stupid pump it's gonna
feel like it's cramping
right right and keep in mind this is
only uh you know this is for the pump
day of hsp training or if you're doing
push pull up or whatever it is for the
pump exercise right so don't use this
for like heavy or stretch right this is
strictly for when you're doing the pump
version of intraspeed training the pump
day or the pump exercise
right because that's when you want to
focus on squeezing and getting a maximum
stupid pump you want to focus on the
mind muscle connection you're going to
focus on just
pouring a on the blood and
inflating the out of your chest
right so use bent over cable flies right
you can do them standing i prefer bent
over but you could do them standing
um you could also use a pac-deck machine
but the reason why i prefer cable flys
is simply because you can actually cross
your own remember the goal of your chest
is to actually bring your humerus across
your body right that's why a lot of you
guys don't get crazy contractions on
your packs doing push-ups and bench
presses because you're not really
bringing your humerus you know your
upper arm across your body right you're
not doing humorous horizontal abduction
right act like you're hugging a fat
 right and then squeeze hold that
contracted position
for about three seconds right and again
because you're going to be using a cable
exercise there's going to be a ton
of tension
at the you know at the end of the
movement at the contracted part of the
movement whereas if you're doing like
dumbbells or some there's almost no
tension right at the top so you got to
pick the right exercise for the goal
right for what you're actually trying to
do if you're trying to get a weighted
stretch then it's the other way around
right you want to use uh weighted dips
or you know heavy dumbbell flies if
you're trying to generate power then
obviously you could use the barbell
bench and things like that but when
you're trying to get a crazy
pump and a crazy contraction in your
chest you want to use cable flyers a
pack deck ideally cable flash and again
don't go super heavy right
because then you're going to use too
much front dust so much momentum some
people might even use their triceps to
kind of cheat pick a way that you can do
it keep in mind this is for pump day
right so pick a way that you can do 15
or 30 reps with right and then focus on
just squeezing at the bottom all right i

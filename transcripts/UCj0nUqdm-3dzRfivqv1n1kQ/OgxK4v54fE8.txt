hey guys going on megan here today is
wednesday so of course
another episode of what the [ __ ]
wednesday when we go over
the craziest freakiest physiques and
not just in the world of bodybuilding
but in muscle growth in general
and today we're going to talk about
marcus rowe
my eighth favorite bodybuilder of all
time
um you guys know my fascination with
mass monsters
ever since i was a little [ __ ] i loved
cartoonish freakish physics that's why i
started lifting in the first place
i'm not into that lean super ripped
[ __ ] sucked in physique
that's been trending in the last few
years i've always loved the mask
monsters the broadly
type physiques and who better than
marcus rule the german freak
all right let's get to it so my favorite
body part when it came to marcus roy was
his shoulders i mean this guy had
amazing
[ __ ] shoulders [ __ ] watermelons
on the side of his head i mean look at
this literally like almost as big as his
entire head
this guy was massive let's take a look
at some of his stats pull out the saiyan
scouter
all right wait he was 280 on stage and
for those of you guys i don't know
whether i was that massive that is
that's ronnie coleman territory right so
this guy was a beast
pure monster 280 on stage sometimes some
shows it was 275 but pretty much 280 if
you round it up
um 510 uh just german monster i mean
this guy
inherited all the viking genes and of
course the usual you know four to five
percent body fat that
uh ibb pros have on stage of course
they're always going to claim that it's
lower but we know it's around 45
so yeah this guy was incredible i mean
once again look at his shoulders
right and that's not the only body part
he was known for it's just what stood
out
he also had an amazing chest
and for comparison this is him standing
next to obviously
dennis wolfen keep in mind guys dennis
wolfe did not have small shoulders danny
wolfe actually when he stood by himself
on stage looked amazing but look what
happens
when you put him next to marcus rule i
mean this is insane you know and if you
look at his genetics
you know i mean obviously he had good
genetics right this is him obviously as
a teenager
you know he had good genetics of course
um and you guys know all these freak
you know all these mass monsters all
these freakish physiques it's always a
combination of three things right a
ton of hard work ton of drugs and
obviously great genetics right you can't
just do
you you can't just have two without the
other right
it's always got to be three out of three
for these mass monsters great genetics
ton of drugs and obviously a ton of hard
work you know and you could tell you
know i mean this guy
again once again this was in his late
teens um
great great great great genetics and of
course i'm pretty sure he started
writing around this time
but anyway goes in again
um and i mean how do you go from this to
that
you know the amount of size this guy put
on the amount of lean mass he put on
over the years was incredible and you
can see him here standing next to ronnie
coleman i mean he's one of the very few
guys who actually makes ronnie coleman
look small
you know um and of course this was uh i
think complete 2003
mr olympia but um but yeah you could
definitely see the difference
very very few people stand next to
ronnie cole man and you know look this
one
and it's not just his doubts you could
clearly see you know he also had some 38
lats
crazy wide lats and i remember i was a
teenager when you know when these guys
were on stage and i was
my mind was blown you know i always
wondered how can a human being look
keep in mind guys when i was that young
i knew nothing about steroids so i
actually believed
uh when i was a little kid that uh uh
that these guys were natty you know
i didn't even know what steroids were
until i was like what in my late teens
so i always believed that these guys
were just [ __ ] trained to look this
big
uh but anyway yeah i mean just massive
massive massive
you got him here staying next to flex
wheeler and i know flexwill is known for
being ecstatic and all that but people
forget flexible was not a small dude
especially in the late 90s
he had put on a lot of mass you know he
you know he had that that phil heath
look
but still you know standing next to
marcus rule
he looks [ __ ] pissed here pretty sure
it's for a different reason but
you know you can make a meme out of this
she's like why the [ __ ] you guys putting
me next time
but anyway here you could barely see it
but that's uh
that was the night of champions i
believe 2002
and you have chickavala just checking
out the games you just admiring because
like god damn
he goes is this the right job for me
like like maybe i should switch careers
but yeah man
marcus was a monster one of my favorite
bodybuilders and i said he's in my top
ten he's number eight
and i believe that was the same show and
you have paul de la looking at him like
you know what the [ __ ]
you know and keep in mind paul dulat was
a monster he's also gonna be on one of
the episodes of what the [ __ ] wednesday
because he was another mass monster
here's another picture here final line
you can clearly see he dwarfs party lad
and guys
paul dulat is not small he's a [ __ ]
behemoth it's the viking jeans man
another picture here bold adults crazy
chest
but unfortunately uh he didn't you know
he wasn't really uh
he never plays really hard to mr olympia
not only he was going against
much better physiques but of course you
know you know he has some weak body
parts especially from the back right
you understand this guy was going
against ronnie coleman and his prime
jay cutler uh obviously kevin levrone
all these guys so it was almost
impossible to be in the top five
unless you were you know unless you came
in not just with
monstrous size but incredible
conditioning and very very few people
had that but anyway guys
let me know what you guys think about
marcus rule the german freak
again one of my favorite mask monsters
of all time we're not gonna see a
physique like that for a long time i
mean even right now one of the biggest
guys we have is big grammy
and he's not even close uh in my opinion
to to the freak factor that you know
marcus rule had but let me know what you
guys think about his physique
where would you rank him as far as the
mass monsters go do you think he's a top
three top five

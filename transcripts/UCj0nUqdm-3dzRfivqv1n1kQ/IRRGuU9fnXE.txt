hey guys what's going on megan here back
with another video sorry i had to take a
break as usual you guys already know the
deal
when the stock market gets volatile i
gotta take breaks from videos
very hard to manage both so obviously i
gotta focus on my page the bills
but anyway so top tier tuesday you guys
requested
most anabolic fruits so let's get to it
first of all i'm only focusing on the
top 30 and most popular fruits right
so don't be mentioning some off-the-wall
type [ __ ] right
because this list could be as long as 80
90 items now before we begin our fruits
anabolic
indirectly of course right obviously
they don't directly increase protein
synthesis
but indirectly they do right they help
with a lot of things that we're going to
discuss soon
and i know they get a very bad rap in
bodybuilding but again the reason why
most bodybuilders are deficient
in minerals and vitamins is because we
don't eat enough fruits stop
being scared of fruits guys they're
delicious they're healthy
and here i'm gonna rank them based on
which ones are the most nutrient dense
so when i say most anabolic fruits i'm
really referring to the ones that are
the most
that have the most nutrients right
that's really what's going to help drive
hypertrophy
when combined with a high protein diet
of course all right so let's look at the
benefits of fruits they're going to help
you with testosterone production mainly
through vitamin c and
antioxidant properties they'll help you
get a nice
sick pump in the gym right mainly
through potassium and nitric oxide
production
depending on the fruits we're talking
about of course they're gonna help with
fat loss
mainly through increasing carnitine
they're going to help with digestion
right digesting the protein that you eat
mainly through protein enzymes protease
i made a lot of videos about that so
bromelain propane and things of that
nature
right what's the point of eating high
protein diet if your body is not
absorbing most of that protein
they're going to help with insulin
sensitivity which is obviously going to
help you put on muscle faster
and lose fat and at an optimal rate
foods however recovery
again mainly through the vitamins and
minerals that i mentioned so vitamin c
helping with free radicals and of course
they're gonna help you with energy
mainly by replenishing liver glycogen
not muscle glycogen liver glycogen
so in the morning or pre or post workout
very very good time to eat fruits
remember it doesn't matter how much
glycogen your muscles have once your
liver glycogen is low you're gonna feel
tired of burnt out and fruits are number
one when it comes to replenishing liver
glycogen
so back to the video i'm gonna go really
fast because there's too many items all
right you guys are familiar with the
list i'm about to nut that's the best of
the best [ __ ] amazing next best
okay that's average bad and pure garbage
so let's go bananas guys bananas
they're kind of overrated right i'm
gonna put them out okay right they're
kind of overrated
uh based on their nutrient density yes
they have some potassium
yes that tastes delicious but as far as
driving the hypertrophy process
by by contributing a lot of vitamins and
minerals
um that in the okay category remember
these are ranked relative to each other
next you have apples also overrated
right i'm going to put them at okay
i'm not going to put them at the top of
any meal plan right again this is based
on nutrient density
pineapples i'm going to put in my
[ __ ] amazing right not only to have a
lot of nutrients but it's one of the few
fruits that actually have protein
digesting enzymes in this case bromelain
so if you're farting a lot your body's
not digesting your protein right right
try to increase your pineapple intake
um next you have blueberries i'm going
to put in my [ __ ] amazing
packed packed with nutrients next
tangerine is very high in vitamin c
i'm gonna put those out okay same thing
with oranges right pretty much in the
same category right the main benefit is
this is high in vitamin c but there are
better options
next you have grapes grapes also go in
the okay category
right not gonna put those higher very
good source of resveratrol though next
you have watermelons i'm gonna put
watermelon i wanted to put out [ __ ]
amazing but the main benefit is mainly
increasing the pump right a lot of
citrulline help you increase nitric
oxide
uh give you a sick [ __ ] pup in the
gym in fact a lot of old people are
recommended to eat watermelon i'm gonna
have erectile dysfunction
so very good source of citrulline next
we have nectarine i'm gonna put that in
okay category same thing with peach okay
category
guavas i'm gonna put those that [ __ ]
amazing they are the highest
when it comes to vitamin c out of every
[ __ ] fruit
next papaya again also [ __ ] amazing
mainly because it has propane which is
again protein digesting enzymes you
gotta get your enzymes guys
can be eating high protein diet with low
enzymes next you have a cantaloupe i'm
gonna put that okay
it's very hard to find a food that goes
in bad or pure garbage olives yes
if i was gonna put those they're [ __ ]
bad but nah i'll just go in okay
category
apricots also gonna go in okay plums are
also gonna go in okay
pomegranates are gonna go in [ __ ]
amazing not only the high nutrients but
they're very very good for the pump
if you're doing hsp training very very
good to eat on the pump day
blackberries again [ __ ] amazing most
berries are full of nutrients so they're
gonna go in [ __ ] amazing
raspberries [ __ ] amazing uh
strawberries the only berries that are
gonna go in okay
right they're very overrated cherries
are high in nutrients but i'm gonna put
those in the okay category
as well dates are freaking delicious
especially my middle eastern
[ __ ] you guys know what i'm
talking about
dates are very [ __ ] delicious um but
as far as nutrient density they go in
the okay category
cranberries are also gonna go in okay
again the high nutrients but not as high
as the berries that i put up here not as
high as blueberries especially rice
in fact raspberries is actually the most
nutrient dense uh
fruit on the planet so um but anyway
durian
uh most people don't have access to this
unless you live in the east some stores
carry it very expensive though because
it's so rare but i'm going to put that
one at the case you know very high
nutrients in fact some people call it
the king of fruits but uh it smells like
[ __ ]
and um doesn't really hold the candle to
the items up here
lime goes in okay lemon also goes in
okay right
mainly high in vitamin c but it's pretty
average when it comes to the other
nutrients
kiwi is obviously and i'm about to nut
category
made a lot of videos about this in the
past pairs going
uh you know what pet peers is the only
one i was gonna put in bad because as
far as nutrient density it is so low
uh but it tastes [ __ ] amazing so i'm
gonna put them out okay right
even though taste is not really the
criteria that i'm using for this list
um i'm gonna put these at the bottom
here mangoes
okay and obviously avocado i'm about to
not so really if you look at the list
guys
the top two fruits that should be on
your list are
kiwis avocados right you gotta eat those
daily
followed by pineapple blueberries guava
papaya
pomegranate blackberries and raspberries
right
so the bulk of your anabolic diet should
revolve around those fruits and the ones
in the okay category you could just eat
them
you know maybe once or twice a week but
as far as getting the best bang for your
buck
you cannot go wrong with the items in
the top two sections all right i hope

hey guys what's going on megan here you
guys have been asking for this video
for so [ __ ] long so here it is anyway
so take a look
at the difference in lean body mass
between the placebo group
and the egg distilling group right
insane
[ __ ] difference and this is the study
by as a man that came out in 2019
and this is the change in bench press
performance one rep max
strength it was flat bench by the way
not inclined but yeah look at the
difference
in strength gains from the distal one
group right insane
and this was just 12 milligrams of like
this throne compared to the placebo
group
this is close to steroid-like gains
right not equal but very [ __ ] close
activist throne is no [ __ ] joke guys
and now you see why year after year i
keep recommending
eating his shits on a quinoa and a [ __ ]
ton of spinach but anyway
this is another episode of testosterone
thursday obviously we normally talk
about testosterone related stuff on this
day
but since you guys have been asking for
this video for so long i said why the
[ __ ] not
so you'll finally get to see why
destrone is
the most anabolic compound natural
compound i should say in the world but
technically protein is but you know what
the [ __ ] i mean all right so first what
is a glycerol right so let's bring out
the vegeta
scouter all right so it's just a molting
hormone guys right
so homo that insects use uh to [ __ ]
mold right turn into for example
caterpillars turning into butterflies
and [ __ ] right it's also found in plants
mainly as a self defense mechanism
because think about it guys if you're a
caterpillar
munching on the spinach over here and
the spinach has a lot of
uh [ __ ] like this wrong well it's
gonna speed up the molting process
you're gonna turn into a butterfly
it's pretty much the plant's way of
saying [ __ ] up go eat something else
right
so in insects it's mainly a molting
hormone
allows them to [ __ ] evolve and [ __ ]
you know kind of like pokemon right
[ __ ] metapod turning into butterfree
and [ __ ] right
so that's mainly what it does in uh in
insects
in humans it's anabolic as [ __ ] right so
obviously it increases protein synthesis
uh it increases strength as you guys
have seen
uh it increases the recovery ability
allows you to adapt to stress faster
and it obviously improves insulin
sensitivity right it has a bunch of
other functions but for the sake of this
video we're just going to focus on
the stuff that we care about it even has
some neuroprotective effect
and this is nothing new guys like this
throne has been around for
decades right it's been studied in
mammals in
so many different animals and and the
results have been pretty consistent like
i said in
insects it works mainly by activating
the actazone receptor in humans
it works mainly by activating the
estrogen better receptor right the beta
receptor not the alpha receptor right
these are two completely different
receptors
obviously the alpha receptor is the one
that most people are terrified of right
you feel bodybuilder whereas the beta
receptor is actually the good one right
the one that mediates the anabolic
effects of estrogen now how anabolic is
it in humans it's extremely anabolic as
you can see here
from the azaman study the sibo group
actually lost lean body mass
um whereas the disturbance group put on
a ton of gains
right and keep in mind this was only 12
milligrams of like this thrown right the
capsules actually
claim to have a lot more than that but
like i told you guys
most supplement companies are full of
[ __ ] right it actually came out to only
12 milligrams
for group one and the high dose it was
about 48 milligrams
and look at the gains the alien body
matters keep in mind this is not water
weight right they actually measured
water weight as well
so most of the gains in lean body mass
was mainly muscle and this is only after
10 weeks of training
as you can see here those are the gains
in bench press [ __ ] 20
pounds added to that bench press and
these guys were trying to lift i think
they had like at least a year of
training experience
that's insane guys meanwhile the placebo
group only put on six pounds i'll put
the link to the study and description so
you can check out the details
but this is insane guys this is again
this is almost
in steroid territory now as far as
squats the the gains were actually
similar
but um bench press insane and the reason
why i love this study so much was
because it was
very very carefully designed they did a
full body workout i believe it was three
times a week
uh progressively overload everything in
fact the study was supported by water
right world anti-doping agency because
they actually wanted to know hey is this
thing
the just keep in mind guys this storm
has been out like since the what
i think the russians were using it back
in the 80s or some [ __ ] they should call
it the russian secret
so it's been around for a long [ __ ]
time but most of the experiments were
done on animals and the ones in humans
were not very conclusive so this was the
most
diligent well done study on humans prior
to that you have the one that was done
on rats right as you can see here do you
have the control group
uh the edd group that's really tremble
locks not tremble on tremolox it's
pretty much in the same family right the
nandrollon family
right so very similar to deca uh the md
group that was dynaball
again you had psalms that's the s1 group
and look at this though on right
look at the difference right this is the
full increase by the way in size
crazy and this is given pound per pound
right so i think it was five milligrams
per kilogram for the rat so given the
exact same dose
look how much more powerful egg
distribution was
right pound for pound that was stronger
than psalms it was stronger than diana
ball
it was stronger than tremblox again not
tremble on tremblox
and if you look here at the myo2
diameter look at that once again dht
igf-1 and then you have like glycerol
right
again same dose and look how much like
this throne was able to
and keep in mind this is just like this
throne right the more powerful version
like this one is turkish throne so they
were only using like this one
if they were using turkish around it
would have been probably 20 to 50 more
so it's anabolic in humans anabolic in
rats and if you think about it anabolic
and insects right because they're
[ __ ] molten and [ __ ] right and the
best part is it has
no side effects you know it's been
studied extensively
uh mainly researchers were trying to
find side effects you know they couldn't
find any because keep in mind that
they're trying to use this thing to
actually
uh help patients and stuff you know
they're not just trying to we're not
researching this for bodybuilders
you know it's mainly researchers looking
for a way to treat
uh muscle wasting diseases without
having the side effects that come with
testosterone and the final proof
of how anabolic this is this is
hilarious because
you guys know me i'm obsessed with the
human body and hypertrophy muscle growth
so i'm
always always um keeping up with the
latest research and especially
uh the monitoring program of water right
because every year they release whatever
compounds they believe
uh should be banned or you know that are
considering banning and
sure enough look you know the 2021
monitoring program like this one is
right there see anabolic agents
obviously you have better two agonists
this is where stuff like clan would go
right claim beautiful but anyway see
anabolic agents like this are all right
the funny thing is i've been keeping
tabs on this program for [ __ ] years
and guys this is the first time 2020
was the first time in years that they
actually added a compound to the
anabolic agent right because before you
used to be like steroids and stuff like
that
and finally i decided to put up this one
which is funny because again like this
one has been around for so
[ __ ] long like again russians were
using in the 80s guys
but finally after these studies came out
especially the one
when i compared it to steroids and then
the one that came out of humans
uh water was like yeah [ __ ] that let's
put that [ __ ] on the monitoring program
you know so they're actually thinking
about they're considering banning it the
reason why they can't is simply because
i mean
think about it this one is natural it's
found in foods right and
you don't need a lot to see results so
what are they going to do tell people
not to eat spinach not to equinora
that's why it's going to be very very
tough for them to put a restriction
on like this their own right because
like i said you know you don't need a
lot to see
the benefits right and they can't tell
people not to eat [ __ ]
uh spinach and canola before events
that's dumb as [ __ ]
all right and look 2019 look see there
was no anabolic agents 2018
2017 2016. see no anabolic agents all
right
so there hasn't been an anabolic agent
on the monitoring program for
so many i think it's like over 12 years
look 2014 2013
2012 2011 2010
and it goes as far back as 2009 see
there's not been a single
anabolic agent for over 12 years until
those studies and like this strong were
completed they were like yeah [ __ ] that
the russians were not joking
this thing is powerful as [ __ ] but i
guarantee you guys
it's probably not going to get banned
right because if they do decide to ban
it it's going to be in high quantities
they'll probably say hey we're going to
test your blood for higher quantities of
like this their own
um which is again pointless because
people would just get low quantities
from regular food
right so this is how you know how
anabolic existeron is the fact that
white is considering
um keep in mind guys there are a lot of
supplements out there that are very
effective
and are not on a monitoring program i
mean think about it creatine is not on
the [ __ ]
um monitoring program for 2021 and we
know how effective creatine is
right we have so many uh time-tested
supplements out there
that are known to improve your
performance yet they're not on the
monitoring program yet like this one is
which just goes to show how powerful it
is right now how much do you need guys
believe it or not because i see everyone
thinking
you need like this crazy amount of like
glycerol guys
in the study they only use like 12
milligrams for the low group
and they still saw significant gains
that's why i keep telling you guys you
have to hear you don't need that much
additional
to see results right even if you compare
the 48 milligram group to the 12
milligram
look the difference in bench press was
not statistically significant
if you look at the difference in lean
body mass right it wasn't that big of a
difference going from 12 milligrams to
48 milligrams so you don't need that
much
the results and the reason why most
people are confused is because in the
rodent studies they're using five
milligram per kilogram so everyone is
thinking what
five milligram per kilogram let's use
the same doses for humans guys remember
you can use the same dose
for humans that they use on rodents
right you got to convert right five
milligrams per kilogram for
rats that comes out to like 0.8
milligram per kilogram for humans right
you got to do the conversion and in the
eisenmann's study they only used about
0.15 milligram per kilogram for the
lower egg glycerin group and about 0.60
milligram per kilogram for the high this
one group
all right so if you're the average guy
weighing about 170 180 pounds whatever
you only need like 12 to 15 milligrams
maybe 20
right maybe 20 milligrams like this
around a day to see gains
now what is the best way to get it this
throne told you guys it's found in
spinach
it's found in quinoa it's found in ajuga
and it's also found in sumaru right it's
found in a lot of different
weird-ass plants and [ __ ] but like i
said keep it simple man
eat a ton of spinach eat it selling
kanoa and you should be set right
ajuga has a ton of turkish throne but
again it's a rare ass plant
very [ __ ] hard to get and i'm pretty
sure you guys are going to be munching
on sumo roots and [ __ ] right
so no need to waste your money on these
weird ass extracts
equinoa and spinach for example one
ounce of quinoa again as long as it's
high quality
100 quinoa and it's not mixed with a
bunch of [ __ ]
right so one ounce of quinoa has like
eight to ten milligrams of rectangle
right
so two ounces of dry canola comes out to
obviously more than that if you cook it
right because it's gonna absorb water
and [ __ ] but anyway two ounces of dry
canola is going to give you more than
enough like glycerol to see gains right
spinach has slightly less it depends on
different factors but about one ounce of
dry spinach gives you about
anywhere from one to ten milligrams of
of a glycerol so
we'll use five milligrams just like the
middle point and yeah adria has a lot
[ __ ] more
and like i said before it has turkish
throne which is a lot more powerful than
the glycerol but
very hard to get your hands on this [ __ ]
so it's best to just keep it simple
right
spanish or kanoa is found everywhere
right so now you see why
i put so much quinoa in spinach in all
my meal plans
and now you see why i've been
recommending quinoa
every [ __ ] year to not just my
friends
my subscribers but most importantly my
clients my clients already know like if
you're on any of my programs you eating
quinoa until you get [ __ ] sick of it
the strength gains are insane now the
million dollar question i always get is
megan should i buy egg distributor on
supplements hell no come on guys i've
answered that question so many times
save your [ __ ] money right most of
these companies are full of [ __ ] i told
you
for example in a study right in the
azerman study the company
claimed that one capsule had about a
hundred milligrams of like glycerol
guess what it only had 12 milligrams
right and it has some shittiest amount
of leucine in it not not even enough to
make a difference
right think about it a company saying
hey this is 100 milligrams in this thing
and it's only 12 milligrams
right so save your money most of these
companies are going to rip you off
anyway
also you don't know what the [ __ ]
they're putting in there they could put
a bunch of fillers they could put
they could put banned substances right
and now you just cashed in your nanny
card because you didn't want to eat some
[ __ ] quinoa
right and lastly remember if water
somehow decides to ban it
as long as you're getting it from quinoa
and spinach you're good right you could
claim natty forever whereas if you're
getting it from some other company
an argument can be made that you're no
longer natty because you're getting
amounts that can be
obtained uh reasonably through food
right so just stick to the quinoa stick
to the spinach
and watch your gains go through the roof
right i say guys quick recap again like
this theron is a nectar steroid it's
that
it's synthesized from cholesterol just
like testosterone
and vitamin d and all the other anabolic
[ __ ] in insects it works mainly through
the active sun receptor
in humans it's mainly through estrogen
receptor beta it is anabolic as [ __ ] in
fact it's the most anabolic supplement
in the world
it's legal it's natural you don't need a
lot of it to see
results it has virtually no side effects
and it works like a [ __ ] charm
right i have no incentive to lie to you
[ __ ] the [ __ ] do i look like am
i sponsored by spinach am i sponsored by
canoa companies hell no right
so try it out and watch your games go
through the roof

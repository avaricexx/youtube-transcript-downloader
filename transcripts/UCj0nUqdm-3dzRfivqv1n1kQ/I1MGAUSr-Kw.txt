hey guys what's going on megan here now
on a milligram to milligram basis right
so comparing
uh dose for those look at how much more
powerful
this one is compared to the testosterone
group
and again this is on a per milligram
basis
now does that mean that ectisteron which
is natural by the way
uh is more anabolic and more powerful
than testosterone well let's find out
now again this is another episode of
testosterone on thursday today's
thursday so obviously we're discussing
testosterone as usual
and lately i've been bombarded with
questions on like this throne and
turkish their own
so pretty much like this one has
hijacked the testosterone thursday
series
anyway let's bring out the fujita
scouter as usual this is what we're
analyzing so i'm picking two different
studies here right so we're taking the
famous classic
uh study from the scene in 96 where he's
pretty much
comparing the effect of testosterone uh
at high and low dosages
versus the effects of training nadi
right so that's the study that uh
i've covered several times where you
have the natty group and you have the
enhanced group and he pretty much wanted
to see uh what the difference in games
would be so i'm using that study but
obviously using testosterone
we're going to focus on a group that's
took 600 milligrams of testosterone
right they're very very very high
uh dose group and then we're going to
compare it to the study that i've
covered last time from eisenmann right
which is the best study done done on
like this throne on humans
uh today where they obviously
administered
uh destroyed i remember on this study
they were giving
i'm using the low dose group right so
they took 12 milligrams
of like this throne per day there's
supposed to be more but again watch the
video that i made on it i go into
details so they got 12 milligrams of egg
glycerol per day
which comes out to 84 milligrams per
week uh compared to this group which
took
600 milligrams of testosterone per week
now first
if you look at the bench price gains
compared to the placebo remember we got
to compare the gains
uh to the placebo group right we can't
just look at the gains from study one
and compare it to getting study two
right because there's obviously
differences in design and things like
that so we're just looking at
uh the gains compared to each study's
placebo group right
so the testosterone group they gained
over 26 more pounds
on their bench press right compared to
the placebo group right so they added 26
pounds to the bench press more
than the placebo group right the
obviously the total game was more than
that
on the octisterone group they've added
about 13 pounds
more than the placebo group right so at
first it looks like testosterone is the
clear winner right i mean
26 pounds more compared to 13 pounds
more than each uh
placebo group but remember the
testosterone group was taking
600 milligrams of test a week that's a
lot right again compared to 84
milligrams
of uh of egg glycerol so even if you
factor out the weight of the ester
that's still
a substantial difference right you're
looking at about 420 milligrams
of testosterone compared to 84
milligrams of like destroying right if
you remove the
testosterone ester so they're using five
to seven
times more again on the milligram two
milligram basis right
then this group for just double the
results so again five to six times more
as far as dose is concerned obviously
they're not the same compound but you
know what i mean right so five to six
times more
right to get about double the gains
not to mention all the side effects that
come with using such a high amount of uh
testosterone now this is where it gets
interesting right so
once you equate the dose right so once
you make it on a milligram per milligram
basis the egg discipline group destroys
the testosterone group uh when it comes
to uh relative gains
right i mean look at the difference from
here to here like dysterone
is no [ __ ] joke guys i've been
telling you guys for over nine years now
eat your spinach eat your know it so
once again now you see why
water pudding this thrown on the
monitoring program again watch the
previous videos that i made on it for
more details
but they were not crazy remember they're
the ones who funded the study right
they're the ones who funded the study
uh from eisenmann and after the results
came out they were like holy [ __ ] you
know keep in mind like i said
this one's been around for decades it's
just we never really had
well-designed studies on humans until
the eisenmann's study
and that's when what i was like [ __ ] it
you know we got to put this [ __ ] on the
monitoring program
it just has way way too many effects
right again in the last video i went
over the anabolic effects right the
effect on strength protein synthesis
insulin sensitivity
recovery blah blah blah but has so many
more if you guys want i could make
more and more videos on the rest of the
effects of this one i mean there's
there's so much research on it you know
it's been studied extensively
even outside of the bodybuilding space
remember water would not put something
on a monitoring program for no reason
right there hasn't been a single
anabolic adrenaline for what i think it
was like over 10 years or something like
that
but the reason why they haven't been in
yet is they're probably waiting for more
studies you know someone else needs to
replicate the eisenmann study and see
what we find out
now which is stronger does that mean
that a glycerol is strong enough
testosterone not necessarily right
it depends because i'm pretty sure if
you take 600 milligrams of hydrocerone
you're not going to get the same results
as the group who got 600 when it goes to
the chest right
it just doesn't work like that it's just
like this one is much more powerful than
testosterone at
low doses right so if you're taking a
low dose of rig this one which again
like i said you don't need a lot to see
gains you know something like 12 to 30
milligrams a day
which is easily found in uh canola and
spinach and [ __ ] you guys i'm not saying
quinoa that should sound stupid as [ __ ]
but anyway uh if you're getting low
doses of like glycerol
uh you're getting more bang for your
buck compared to low doses of
testosterone but obviously if you go to
the high doses
testosterone is skinning of course but
testosterone comes with the side effects
whereas like this one does not remember
like this one there's virtually
zero zero side effects on animals and on
humans
no liver toxicity no acne no hair loss
no issues with your blood lipids no
testosterone suppression
none of that right and it's natural
whereas testosterone at high dosages
comes with a [ __ ] ton of issues again
depending on your genetics and things
like that how you respond to it
all right so which is stronger again at
high doses testosterone is king
whereas at low doses uh like destroying
this king right and again like this one
tends to have this weird effect where as
you keep increasing the
the doses you're not getting uh
a stronger and stronger effect you know
it's kind of weird which is why we need
more studies
to follow up on the azimuth study
because if you remember in the last
video
the group who had four times the amount
of hectares thrown as the 12 milligram
group
did not see uh substantially more gain
so
it seems like a disroan tends to peak
after you reach a certain amount which
is probably around the 30 milligram
per day dose whereas testosterone
obviously
you know you keep on making more gains
as you increase the dose
up to a limit of course so conclusion uh
testosterone wins
at high doses and a glycerol wins at low
doses right
and when you look at pros and cons and
side effects then like this one
wins by far and that's mainly because
like i explained before this one mainly
works through the estrogen beta receptor
whereas testosterone
uh not only works to the androgen
receptor but through many of the
pathways
even outside of uh dna binding so
long-term dendrogen receptors just way
more anabolic
uh than the estrogen beta receptor again
long term and at high doses
now another question i get a lot is
megan should i buy a turkey serum from
derek ammo place more dates
so i recently found out that he actually
sounds like it's wrong with your pretty
[ __ ] badass because like i mentioned
several times it's very very hard to get
your hands on
on turkish on the right stuff especially
if you're trying to get it from foods
forget it
so if he was able to uh make a legit
character on supplement
then kudos to him now as far as whether
you should buy a turkish own supplement
i might make a whole video on that right
because usually my answer is always hell
no but
that's mainly because i don't trust my
supplement companies right and from
watching
his review of my video he seems like a
pretty honest guy
he was objective science-based and even
he was skeptical
about most of my companies right so i
would say you know it's up to you guys
um long as it's legit i don't see why
not i personally
like to stay away but that's for my own
personal reasons like i said one
uh i like to know exactly what's in most
of the products that i use
uh and two like i mentioned before we
just don't have a lot
of human data on uh terchesterone we
just know that in animal models
it's more anabolic and i would assume
it's also more anabolic in humans i
don't see why not
uh we just need more studies and we just
need more data on it in fact i would be
so excited
if we finally get some uh well-designed
studies
on the effects of turkish throne because
i've been waiting for that for
years but anyway like i said i make a
whole video on tokyo show and eventually
you know it's pretty much like this
throwing on crack right just about 20
stronger and pretty much the exact same
effects all right let's say guys let me

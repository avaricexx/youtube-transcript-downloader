and the only people in my opinion who
should be on tlt or steroids up
hey what's going on megan here alright
today's thursday so we're going to
answer questions related to testosterone
right for the starts from thursday all
right and this is the question that
called my my attention positives and
negatives over tlt dose hi all any
negatives positives with a dose of 300
milligrams a week and i'm gonna address
that in a minute not really thinking
about gains it's more for the mental
effects thanks and obviously answered
before making a video literally just now
and i figured it's worth uh it's worth a
video right so i put first off 300
milligrams is far from trt it's a
straight up steroid cycle right so let's
get that out of the way and depending on
the person it can show you towards the
stats run to over 1300 or 1500 nanograms
per deciliter which is obviously way out
of the
uh the range for now but it doesn't
really matter because even normal tlts
literally just load those steroids right
it's about what many people say even if
it puts you in a natural range let's say
300 to a thousand you still be far from
that essential free testosterone levels
would be high as way higher than
90s and your total t will stay elevated
between injections relative to me to uh
to 90s regardless whether you sleep at
eat bad eli crap um you know train too
much whatever
all right and i already made a video
about this right you know debunking the
whole oh i'm natural because
grt puts me in a in a natural range you
know i hate that that lie that
many fitness influences like you know
like to toss around right i wanted more
detail in that video pretty much when
you're on trt even if your total
testosterone levels are in a normal
range you still have super high free to
start some levels obviously because high
dose tlt lowers your sexual body and
globulin and if you don't believe me
that's so easy to prove i mean i could
just look at the blood work of my
clients right the ones who are naughty
the free just starts on levels let's say
i have a natty client and he's told us
to stop someone's let's say 600 his free
testosterone is always lower uh than the
ones who are on trt and my clients who
are on tlt and have the same total
testosterone levels right it's night and
day difference again mainly because ssbg
gets crushed so hard
when you hide those uh testosterone
especially my clients would only drag
frequently right it's a drastic
difference and like i said you know even
if the free testosterone levels were not
higher than the nettie the fact that
they have all the benefits of
testosterone without having to work for
it so it doesn't matter how to sleep how
to eat how to manage stress
they always have that constant elevation
in between the injections right which is
obviously a cheat code so again
doesn't matter how many ways people try
to spin it tlt is not natural get the
 out of here um let's keep going but
anyway here all the mental benefits of
the stats and replacement therapy that i
can take out right now pretty much the
same benefits as having very high
natural testosterone levels right so
it's the same benefits uh just whatever
to work for it right so again energy
more energy more motivation more
confidence willingness to compete and
move up in status a better sleep and i
put it depends because again it depends
on the person most people get
improvements in sleep some actually get
sleep apnea uh higher libido obviously
higher sex drive better memory
verbal and spatial memory better focus
so less brain fog
better spatial skills better
construction scale so that's drawing
building um plus an output plus
whatever other mental benefit you reap
from the non-mental positives right so
more strength more muscle faster fat
loss more adrenaline receptors more
androgen receptors uh better insulin
sensitivity faster glycogen synthesis
more bone density faster recovery from
training
more satellite cells in my nuclei more
fish blah blah blah right so be pretty
much getting all of these g codes
uh you know from tlt but now let's talk
about the negatives right which is which
is why i'm so against tlt unless you
fall into two categories that i always
mention right and i put again all
negatives depending on genetics the dose
and the duration of use right so
obviously uh it depends on your genetics
right different people have different
side effects
obviously uh the dose uh for example is
the big difference between 100
milligrams 200 milligrams and obviously
uh you know 300 400 400 milligrams right
because you'd be surprised that when
people say that they're on trt when
really they're on massive doses you know
like up to 600 milligrams of
testosterone it's not tlt right and like
i said depending on your genetics uh
even 300 milligrams can put you way over
1200 nanogram per deciliter but anyway
so yes i just put you know off the top
of my head all of the side effects that
i can think of this is this is from trt
and also high dose steroids right so
obviously hpg is pressure so that's
obviously your hypothalamus pituitary
gonadoaxis so that just suppress the
negative feedback loop so long story
short your body starts making natural
testosterone we all know this by now
next infertility once again from hbga
suppression right it's just your effects
crossed right negative feedback loop
once again means your hypothalamus is no
longer releasing an entropy listing
hormone meaning your pituitary gland is
not no longer releasing uh luteinizing
hormone and fsh right and such a
physicist crush
goodbye sperm cells um again hair loss
balding and again i put it depends
wherever i put it depends go back to
here right the brazilian genetics the
dose duration i use whatever
obviously if you're not susceptible to
hair loss you know it's not going to
affect you but again acne depends dino
depends um your ball shrink again due to
hpga suppression uh your lipid balance
right so your hdl gets crushed some
people the ldl goes down as well but
again you know again it depends uh it
wrecks out this function obviously once
you come off and and also if you don't
hide those steroids you know keep in
mind i'm lumping up trt and and high
dose steroids uh side effects here but
if you're on let's say an envelone or or
any psycho
lacking testosterone base you definitely
are going to have erectile dysfunction
for the most part again i should say
definitely because it depends also if
you're lacking in this fast on base
meaning you also don't have estrodial
then you're definitely alright so
if you look at the literature of people
who on daca only cycles where i said
only taking androlone or dsu derivatives
that obviously don't convert to estrogen
they tend to have a lot of issues with
not only sex drive but also erectile
dysfunction like i said depending on the
person and genetics and things like that
since you obviously need a good balance
of estradiol and your other androgens
for proper
sexual function but anyway liver damage
again depends obviously if you're taking
overall uh steroids for long periods of
time again your ssb3 gets crushed like i
mentioned earlier and i put way too much
right because obviously low estrogen is
not so bad right because you obviously
want more free testosterone but if it
gets crushed to the point where it's so
low well one now you can't even
um keep in mind asbg is a good marker
for insulin sensitivity so if your hpg
is super low you can't really tell if
it's because uh to start showing cross
shadows because you have liver damage or
if it's because your insulin sensitivity
 right very hard to tell and also
keep in mind that you need ssb to
transport testosterone
um through the blood right as well as
argument prostate problems right so
prostate cancer prostate enlargement um
once again it depends uh blood clots
pulmonary embolism from the increase in
hematocrit right all these uh all that
increase in red blood cells that gives
you a ton of energy and all that stuff
right remember inverted you curve too
much of anything can become bad um again
heart disease heart attack stroke
especially heart attacks right it's not
coincidence that all these guys on
royals are dying like flies you know
especially when you combine
um when you combine it with other
diseases and other illnesses and things
that are going around that i can't
mention right now keep in mind i should
put it depends here because some people
actually get improvements
in heart health
uh on trt where some get the complete
opposite so that's what you're saying it
depends right again uh sleep apnea once
again it depends some people get better
sleep some actually get worse sleep uh
mood swings again it depends but if you
come off uh your cycle or if you uh have
infrequent injections then you're
definitely gonna have mood swings right
because you're gonna have this high
spiking testosterone and these huge uh
crashes um in fact that's one of the
reasons why testosterone was uh steroids
were banned was because a lot of people
were coming to suicide back in the days
you know decades ago
and this is still happening to this day
although not you know in the same uh
although not the same degree but anyway
negative regression and again there's
difference between positive regression
and negative regression and i put it
depends because it depends on your
personality right since testosterone
really amplifies your behavior so if
you're a dick you're going to be a
bigger dick imposter syndrome right
mainly right and this one is one of the
most underrated one right imposter
syndrome right because mainly because
all of your your accomplishments that
you're gonna all the things that you're
gonna accomplish from having higher
testosterone levels right you know other
mental benefits right more confidence
more energy all the success that's gonna
come from that some people get imposter
syndrome right because it's hard for
them to reconcile the fact that those
achievements didn't come really from
them right they came from exogenous uh
steroid use right exaggerated assassin
use so some don't give a depending
on the personality where some get
positive syndrome because they're like
wait did i really accomplish that am i
was i really capable of uh
of doing those things or or is it only
because i'm you know injecting steroids
up my ass i said that's one of the least
talked about
side effect you know which is why i
 avoid just that's what i like to
play right i avoid steroids and tlt like
to play because i'm big on looking at my
accomplishments and knowing that i did
it my goddamn self right and i did not
have a massive advantage over my
competition especially when it comes to
steroids right obviously you can't
eliminate all your advantages in life
right we're all born with privileges and
advantages depending on
you know who we are and how we're raised
the country we're born in whatever
but the advantage that steroids give you
is so massive that i refuse to tarnish
my achievements uh with something like
that so there's some pride in knowing
that you achieved your body or you
achieved your um cognitive development
or your uh your achievements naturally
by anyway uh suicide again like i said
it depends and this one you once
you come off depending on how effective
your post psychotherapy cycle is right
so
back to the suicide thing right once you
come off you right because once
again you no longer have a way of
producing natural testosterone right
yeah your adrenals are gonna produce
some testosterone but
not enough to put you back in the normal
range um so again i'm gonna have mood
swings you're gonna suffer from all
these uh
issues from no longer having uh natural
testosterone and from also not having
natural uh
estrodiol right domain estrogen right so
low levels of estrogen as well you're
also going to have low dhea which has
its own benefits right in terms of
controlling inflammation
antagonizing cortisol
increasing nitric oxide increasing igf-1
sensitivity right remember dhea has a
lot of benefits apart from testosterone
and you're also going to have low dhea
once your hpga is shut down um so yeah
so you definitely once you come off
um again depending on how effective your
pct is some people recover fast some
people take some a long time to recover
and in fact some people commit suicide
while they own pct because it's taking
too long for
uh everything to go back to homeostasis
uh again i put lifetime commitment the
fact that you want for life right
especially once your
um hpga is shut down
and last but not least everything that
makes you a man now comes from a bottle
instead of your own two balls all right
and i put parenthesis you're now renting
your masculinity right which is one of
the biggest reasons in addition to what
i mentioned earlier why i refuse um to
hop on trt and trust me i have plenty of
opportunities you know how many times my
testosterone always got crushed because
i had sleep nutrition even
when i was in college at one point my
tea levels went down to like 150. now
they're grandfathers later um they were
in the 200s for a long time when i was
sleeping like eating like you
know i'm living a very very very
stressful lifestyle you know being a
father
managing my businesses trading stocks i
mean so many times i was in clinically
hyper-connected territory and i still
refuse to hop on tlt right went to the
doctor that would tell me oh you know
let me send you to an endocrinologist
right and i was like no i'm gonna
do my goddamn stuff and here i am today
right so it is definitely doable uh to
increase your levels naturally as long
as you put all the excuses away right
that's not easy right it's a pain in the
ass you have to manage sleep you have to
reduce stress you have to
manage your nutrition like a
 but it is well worth it
right so
again everything that makes you a man
that comes from a bottle right i don't
know how people can like live with that
 right i'm gonna walk around knowing
that my strength my size my muscles my
motivation my ambition you know all
these benefits here i like walking
around knowing that that comes from my
 testicles and my own brain right
there's huge pride in that right the
last thing i want is to have all of
these benefits all this focus all this
energy all the all these are um you know
what's obviously going to lead to a lot
of achievements and to look at the
mirror and and think wait a minute i
only got this
because i was on exogenous testosterone
 that i would rather fail as a natty
they succeed as a roid head but again
that's just my opinion right again i i
uh at the end of the day i don't want to
push my my belief on others um and i
don't want to be a hypocrite right
because let's be honest like i always
say the reason why i try so hard not to
judge people who are on the juices
because i myself was inspired by roid
heads right i'm in love with roy has
ronnie coleman arnold schwarzenegger jay
cutler kevin levrone all the guys that
got me into bodybuilding although the
reason why i used to go to the gym when
i was a teenager right it was a bunch of
roid heads right without them i wouldn't
be bodybuilding i started lifting
because of dragon ball z brawley you
think bradley would be natty if he was a
a real person you know vegeta my
favorite character when he became jacked
as right when he became super
vegeta that motivated me to train hard
as you can't achieve that physique
naturally right so at the same time i
don't want to be a hypocrite right
because a lot of us 90s were inspired to
stop bodybuilding because of whiteheads
um i just personally choose not to go
down that path right and i put here um
that's all i can think of for now as as
i always say the negatives fall our way
to positives and the only people in my
opinion who should be on tlt or steroids
are professional athletes getting paid a
 ton of money to risk their lives
and sick people who for whatever reason
you know including disease accidental
genetics can no longer produce
testosterone no matter what everyone
else should manually up and boost
the levels naturally right so if you're
in one of those two categories if you're
a professional athlete down give a
right if you're an irb professional then
obviously you're going to be on the
roads right because how the you're
going to uh move up the ladder right if
you're in the nfl and you write it up i
don't give a because guess what
that's something you chose to do that's
your career that's how you put money on
the table um and you're gonna get out
competed by the ones who are the juice
right so the people who are getting paid
millions of dollars to be on roy's
you know if you're wearing their shoes
you'd probably do the same thing you
know i wouldn't but a lot of people
would so i can't really blame them right
it's the life dream it's the life's goal
like again the ronnie coleman's of the
world the the phil heaps right if that's
what made them happy they should put
money on the table who am i to judge and
um and like i said you know the people
who are sick and
keep in mind testosterone steroids were
invented for sick people in the first
place right people that uh that when icu
burn victims hiv patients cancer
patients who are wasting away with
losing muscle mass those are the people
that steroids were engineered for so if
you lose two categories by all means
take all the drugs in the world
but everybody else
stay the away from uh exogenous
testosterone by the way guys that's just
my opinion at the end of the day i'm not
a doctor so i can't tell you
what to do with your health and i'm also
not god so i can't tell you what to do
with your life uh that's just my uh my

hey guys going on megan here
why do black people build muscle faster
that's a question that i get so much
it's never going to go away
um and there are different theories
right so i'm saying hey you know it's
just
it's a myth you know it's not really it
doesn't exist it's just an illusion you
know some are saying it must be because
of slavery you know it's probably one of
my most hated theories
because i'm gonna show you guys how it's
complete nonsense
uh they're like hey it's because of
selective breeding and you know doing
slavery blah blah blah
um which has been debunked so many times
but i'll go over that in a video
uh some saying oh it's just hard work
you know you know the reason why black
people dominate sports and
you know mainly fast twitch related
sports uh just because they just work
harder which
again a lot of bs and i'm black uh
and obviously some say hey it's just the
bbc genetics so so what's the answer
what's the answer well really
it's uh it's a combination of many
factors it's somewhere in the middle
all right let's get to it so first is it
true is it true
do black people actually have a genetic
advantage
uh when it comes to building muscle or
you know obviously you know a fast twist
related sports you know for those of you
guys who don't know you obviously have
slow twitch and fast race muscles
the ones that grow bigger from training
obviously your fat fascist muscles by
now everyone should know this
fast switch muscles is what we're really
referring to not the slow twist ones
so do black people have an advantage in
that you know in that field right well
let's see first let's look at sprints
right the 100 meter dash
which is the sport that is the most
uh related to uh fast switch you know
muscle performance right you know you're
not going to
win the 100 meter dash if you have you
know shitty
uh fastest genes and obviously it's
dominated by black people rights
dominated by um
about west african descendants um
especially jamaicans
right so look at the statistics right
the top
10 fastest man on the planet as far as
the 100 meter dash goes a black
the top 10 fastest women are black if
you look at the 10 second barrier right
you know
trying to beat the 100 meter dash in
less than 10 seconds
um i think the first white man will
actually do it was in 2010
and it's been broken in 1968 but
obviously you know so pretty much from
1968
to 2010 every person who broke that
record i think it's
71 people who did it 71 people ran the
100 meter dash
under 10 seconds and 70 of them were
black
which is insane uh the set the other
person
is uh uh aboriginal which is another
[ __ ] right so
pretty much 100 of the people who who
broke the 10 second barrier you know
before 2010
were black men right so obviously
there's something going on here you
can't tell me that oh man
they just run so much harder and they're
just trained so much harder than
everybody else right you think asians
don't train hard you think white people
don't train hard you know i mean even as
a black person you can look at
the results and be like whoa something
is going on here um let's look at
uh the nba right 70 of the nba is black
you know the top 10 greatest basketball
players of all time only
one guy on that list no matter who you
ask only one guy on that list is white
you know my man larry bird i love larry
bird
so 90 of the top 10 greatest players of
all time in basketball
are black is that a coincidence you mean
to tell me that they just work harder
than everybody else you know they just
work harder than every other race that
that's obviously not you know not the
case
um next the nfl again about 70
you know depending on where you're
looking at it but about 70 on the nfl
um it's black why do you think that
especially let's focus on the cornerback
position which is obviously the position
that requires the most speed
the most fastest muscle uh engagement
uh it's dominated by black people like
why why do you think that is so
obviously something is going on here
right people didn't just come up with
this notion um out of you know out of
nowhere
like i said later in the video i'm going
to explain why but let's keep going
right bodybuilding
right bodybuilding the epitome of muscle
growth the epitome
of you know fast twitch dominance you
know you're not going to win a
bodybuilding show unless you have some
big ass phase muscles right
dominated by blacks for the most part
right i mean just look at
who has the most olympia titles you have
lee haney you know
eight olympia titles right you have a
second place well
actually actually not second place but
tied with lee and he is ronnie coleman
with eight mr olympia toddlers and in
third place you have seven
mr olympiados by phil heath you know and
he's tied with arnold schwarzenegger so
the top three with the most titles of
black is that a coincidence right and
then you have
uh so you have lee haney you have ronnie
coleman
um you have phil heath then you have
arnold and you have dorian yates at six
right so is it a coincidence you mean to
tell me that
they just train harder than everybody
else they just have better
uh more dedication better drugs nah
right there's obviously a genetic
component ever you know
at work here uh let's look at and again
this is up for debate right
boxing tennis things like that that's
pretty much up for debate but if
you say boxing most of the time people
would think muhammad ali
mike tyson tennis when you said tennis
whose name comes to mind
you know serena williams serena williams
is one of the most decorated tennis
athletes
uh if you look at gymnasts the best
gymnast in the world right now as far as
records go is simone biles she's just
killing
the genetics so so what is going on here
now of course it's not every sport you
know you have hockey
there's no black people don't [ __ ]
play hockey if you go to the project you
go to the hood you're not going to see
your [ __ ] you know
uh hiking stadiums and [ __ ] so uh
swimming right they don't diamond
swimming in fact most it's weird because
most african americans actually can't
swim and i'm not going to go to the
reasons why you know
you know i think reasons why whatever um
they don't dominate power lifting
uh they don't dominate strong makeup you
know competitions that's mainly
northern europeans and black people
don't dominate weightlifting you know
it's mainly eurasians you know asians
and
some parts of europe so it's not every
fast-twitch dominant sport
but it's a big big chunk big enough to
raise an eyebrow
but now the question is why you know why
why is this happening now before we get
there first of all beware it's not
all black people that's why i put black
people in quotes right it's not
all black people that have uh this this
you know this ability to just dominate
uh the majority of faster sports it's
mainly
west african descendants right so you
see i
have it here it's mainly west africans
and their descendants the descendants
meaning
anyone if you're an african-american or
from brazil
southern america the islands jamaicans
even puerto ricans dominicans if you
have
if you're a descendant you know of west
africans
um that applause you right so it's not
all blacks it's mainly
people that are descendants or live in
this region right here
right and i have a lot of stories about
this guys especially
especially if you're from ghana nigeria
right mainly this region here those guys
are some of the
jackets [ __ ] i've ever seen
remember guys i i've lived on three
kindness i've had the opportunity
at a young age to live on multiple
communists so i've seen genetics come
and go i've seen every
kind of united you could think about and
as far as west africa goes
nigerians people from ghana and some
people from even cameroon
right so it's not just here you know
some here as well
um these guys are jack then a
[ __ ]
right they respond to training like
crazy and obviously because of the slave
trade
if you're an african-american well you
could trace your roots here right take
the [ __ ] dna test you see what i'm
talking about oh and the funny story
about nigerians so
back when i was in new york right uh one
of my best friends was toby's name was
toby
right and uh this [ __ ] man i
to this day i still can't stand this guy
like i hope he's watching this video
toby because i still hate you for that
him and his two brothers it was him toby
family and his brother cola right
these guys just to show you how crazy
nigerian genetics are these guys could
jump like [ __ ] right and they
did
zero training for that they were just
super
super super genetically gifted i
remember
first of all toby's gonna hate me saying
that but you
he's the psycho ball he's the second
ball right uh
and i'm not surprised because you know
he's a lebron fan but anyway
but everyone will always pick him and
his brothers
on a team why for rebounds because if
you missed the shot
best believe that rebound was going to
get called by either toby or his two
brothers these guys jumped so [ __ ]
high
all three of them they had a full
brother but i never played basketball
with him so i don't know how good his
genetics are but
all three of them had amazing amazing
jumping ability right they jumped so
[ __ ] high
and we used to hate it we should be like
dude why the [ __ ] did you jump so hard
that never tried and the funny thing is
because i have shitty genetics i used to
go out at night
and i should put on ankle weights i
should put on ankle weights and i should
think hey
maybe if i practice at night when
everybody's sleeping i practice my ankle
weights maybe i'm going to jump high one
day you know
never [ __ ] work and these
[ __ ]
never train their calves never did
anything that's
remotely close to training for vertical
jump and they just jump out all three of
them
all three brothers and it doesn't stop
there
because think about it you know to jump
high you obviously need you know fast
muscles in your legs right
these guys put on muscle so
[ __ ] fast i wish i could find some
pictures when we first started training
at csi
oh my god toby cola
and family all three of them you think
it's the coincidence guys
these guys put on muscles so fast
i could not believe it i remember toby
had shoulders that would just
bulge out after just weeks and months of
training
and i should be like what the [ __ ] is
going on i should be so bad cause i'm
like dude
you jump higher than me in basketball
right so i can't even compete with you
there
and then when we start training keep in
mind i was the guy who was obsessed with
building muscle you know i was like i
was
the guy forcing him to come to the gym i
was like toby come on man let's go to
the gym come on come on come on let's
get sold
and he was always like yeah whatever you
know he wasn't really into it
but he would grow like a [ __ ]
right same thing with his brother man
cola was so jacked six-pack
everything so you want to talk about
genetics trust me i've seen it all
but yeah toby if you're watching this
video [ __ ] you i still hate you for that
man like that's you know
and there are tribes same thing there
are tribes in africa you know that are
just
amazingly gifted you know these guys
just the hunters or
the senegalese wrestlers uh the the guys
who do the drums
just insane physical development in fact
the subscribers sent me this picture you
guys probably saw the documentary
documentary came out years ago i
completely forgot about this one but
subscribers sent some send me the
picture
um go watch this video look how jack
this guy is and they're from a tribe in
west africa as well
and keep in mind these guys they're not
they don't have the nutrition that we
have they don't have access to the
equipment that we have
you know they just have those bbc
genetics
but it's not all west africans also
right it's not all west africans
um again i always use myself as an
example right i'm [ __ ] west african
and i've had
i grew up being known as one of the guys
with the worst
effect when i was a kid my friends used
to laugh at me all the [ __ ] time you
know because we used to go out and play
soccer and we had to take our shirts off
you know because we didn't have jerseys
you know when we're playing soccer
outside it was either shirts or skins
right
and i always hated being on the on the
opposite team you know
whenever i was picked to play uh skins i
mean i had to take my shirt off i hated
that [ __ ] right because
i had some of the worst genetics um so
and everyone should laugh at me my
african friends are laughing they're
like dude how are you west africa
and your genetics suck so bad so it's
not all west africans
next it's also not exclusive to africa
guys
and you're gonna see i'm gonna go into
the details whatever yes
the vast majority of those with good fat
swiss genetics
right are going to come from here but
you're also going to see some outliers
some europeans have that right some
asians have that right
so don't think this is only exclusive to
africa i don't think oh you know
like only only no no you know it's
spread out throughout the world it's
just
this is a higher frequency among
africans uh west africans
now why let's see reason number one
right is natural selection right you
can't talk about genetics without
mentioning you know
mentioning natural selection right uh
and obviously by now you guys know what
natural selection is
uh if you're too young if you're a 16
year old guy who's scared biology class
and
you know you know the metro section it's
pretty much your environment decides
which genes are going to activate right
and which genes are going to be passed
on
uh the simplest example the one that we
hear all the time in biology class
is uh the camouflage example right uh if
you're a white mouse
right uh living in a region where the
the ground is white
well you have a camouflage advantage
right so you're gonna pass on your jeans
much faster because
owls and eagles are not gonna spot you
that often
but if you're a black mouse in a region
where the ground is light or white
you're gonna get [ __ ] snapped up 24 7.
every time you go out to you know walk
around and chill with the homies
an ego is going to come out of nowhere
and just snap your [ __ ] up right because
you're easier to spot
so over time if you come you know over
time
the vast majority of the rats who are
going to be on that you know in that
region where this
where the ground is white are going to
be white right and the same thing
you know applause you know a region
where the ground is darker
if the ground is darker then most of the
rats that live there are going to be
dark
because they blend in right so natural
selection so that doesn't mean that the
ground is making people wider black it
just means
the environment helps decide which genes
are going to be passed on
so natural selection plays a huge role
uh as far as why black people just have
those genetics
second reason is african diversity you
know for those of you guys who don't
know
there is so much in fact there's more
genetic diversity in africa than the
rest of the world combined
right you ask any biologist any
geneticist they'll tell you that there's
more genetic
diversity in africa than the rest of the
world
combined and keep in mind there's only
about population of africa is no more
than a billion
there's about 1.2 billion people in
africa right yeah there's more genetic
diversity there
than the other six billion people in the
world combined
right which is insane and of course it
makes sense right because life
originated from africa so obviously
you're gonna have the most
uh genetic variations there so what does
that have to do with black people
putting on muscle fast well think about
it
every genetic ev every gene you could
think about every variation of any gene
you could think about
you're going to find that in africa
think about it the tallest people in the
world
are in africa in fact they're in east
africa right there's a tribe
just tall [ __ ] even the women i
think the average height is like six
feet of some [ __ ] even the women are
tall as [ __ ] right
and again that's obviously you know due
to natural selection you know it's
very hot near the equator you know you
guys know again
the hotter it is you're going to have
longer limbs and things like that
um so the tallest tribe is found in
africa the shortest tribe the pygmies
right and pygmy [ __ ] i believe
they're somewhere around congo
somewhere around central africa right
they're the shortest people on the
planet well guess what
you're going to find those in africa
right so every gene
variation you could think about is going
to be finished so it's no coincidence
that the people who
most jack [ __ ] will also come
from africa but guess what
the skinniest people are also from
africa right so it's not
you know don't see it as you know oh you
know why
why is this so puzzling no it's just
common [ __ ] sense next
west africans have a higher proportion
of fast-forward fibers
why is that i don't want to go into the
details but if you grew up in west
africa you know the story right
it's mainly based on hilarious because
of malaria we have
west africans have uh on average lower
hemoglobin
right on average they have sickle cell
right they have the highest cases of
sickle
cell sickle cell trait and sickle cell
anemia and it's mainly uh
back to natural selection it's because
of malaria right i'm not gonna go into
the details uh
like i said you should have learned that
in school anyway but long story short
malaria ravages to african in fact 90 of
malaria-related deaths are from west
africa right from africa
it's if you grew up in west africa you
terrified at the [ __ ] terminal
right now of course there's vaccines now
and you know um as long as you have
access to healthcare you should be fine
but it destroyed the african population
so
how does malaria work so you have this
[ __ ] ass mosquito i hate this [ __ ]
mosquito because i had malaria
so many times growing up it's it's
insane it's funny when i came to america
i moved to the u.s when i was 11.
and i had to learn english here so it
took me a while for that but i was
amazed that
people didn't know what the [ __ ] malaria
was and i was like what like in africa
you have malaria like every other month
but anyways mosquito the female mosquito
pretty much has to fetus young so what
it does is you know when she's pregnant
she you know she needs blood usually
they go to animals but
in west africa the the mosquito species
that are there they love human blood
right so they come
you know they suck at blood and they
inject the [ __ ]
bacteria that's responsible for malaria
now what the bacteria does is it needs
your red blood cells to multiply right
so
it goes to your liver first and then you
know it infects your red blood cells
and it multiplies now normally if you
have low hemoglobin which is what most
west africans have and their descendants
and if you have
a sickle cell right well you have issues
with your red blood cells right
and that's gonna hinder uh the ability
of the bacteria to multiply
so a disease that normally will snap
your [ __ ] up
ends up being an advantage if there's a
lot of malaria right
because the malaria parasite can't
spread but at the same time
right because you have low low
hemoglobin you know your red blood cells
are not
optimized whatever you have a higher
proportion of fat switch muscles it's
just common sense guys because you guys
remember remember slow twist muscles
those are your oxidative fibers
um that require they need a lot of blood
a lot of oxygen to contract whereas your
muscles that's the reason why they're
you know you know they have that white
color right
no they're not they don't have a lot of
oxygen in fact they
do anaerobic respiration they don't need
oxygen so the people that had a sickle
cell trait right
also had obviously you know higher
proportional fastest fibers
but it's hilarious it's hilarious
because we just have so many theories as
kids we should be like man like oh it's
that time of the year again you know i
have malaria and then
[ __ ] [ __ ] over there never has it
you know
we never knew why you until we got older
but yes long story short
uh west africans that's why west
africans have a higher proportion of
festival but and books were written
about this guys this is not new this is
not a theory it's not bro science the
books are written about this again if
you go to west africa everyone knows
that
um it's literally like night and day you
know people that have sickle cell trait
these guys are so
immune um to learn and when they do
catch malaria they recover so fast
so obviously you know with the slave
trade a lot of african americans
obviously descendants of west african so
that's why they also have
uh you know low hemoglobin and uh sickle
cell trait not sickle cell and even if
you actually suddenly you just [ __ ]
right sickle cell treat you right there
in the middle
so if you have a higher prevalence of
fast risk muscles you could think
this [ __ ] ass mosquito all right next
the actin and gene
black people have the best
combination um of the acting and gene
for those who are not familiar with that
gene
pretty much it's in your fast switch
fibers it calls for protein that's in
your fastest fibers right and it makes
your faster fibers produce more force
contract uh more powerfully right so it
leads to more speed
it protects you from muscle damage so
you can recover quicker from workouts
in short uh it's a gene that's mainly
it's a protein that's mainly found in
fat switch fibers
now you can have three versions of three
versions of this gene
right you can have the rr version which
is you know because you guys know you
inherit
two copies of a gene from your parents
right one from your mom wants me that
right the acting in gene has two
versions right you have the r version
and the x version
the r version means it's fine nothing is
wrong your body is going to make that
protein just fine
and obviously the x version means you
know it's [ __ ] up right as the
mutation
um that in that hinders your body's
ability to make that gene
now obviously since you inherit two
copies of a dream you know from your
parents right so one from you that one
from your mom
if you get the r from your mom and the
all from your dad then you're fine you
have all
r you're good to go your body's gonna
make uh acting in
three your fast muscles are gonna be
powerful it's gonna help you with speed
contraction boom all that good [ __ ] if
you get the
r from your mom the x from your dad a
vice versa
you're still good right you're not all
you're not
all [ __ ] right but at least you
have at least you know you have half of
it right
so your body can still make the gene um
just not as much as obviously
you know the oh [ __ ] now if you
inherit the
ex from your mom and the other acts from
your dad otherwise we're
so right you [ __ ] right because now
your body can't make
you know acting in three um you're not
gonna notice in your everyday life
but at the elite level that's definitely
gonna come in right so because
you know you have access you have no
acting in three so you don't have the
advantage
that that protein provides as far as
force production
and speed and things like that um now
what does this have to do with black
people well guess what
on average 18 of the world population
have the xx version right the [ __ ] up
version
18 of our population have it um
i think white people have about 19 to 20
percent
about 20 of them have the [ __ ] up
version asians is
as high as 25 right so
one in every four asian has it
for west africans it's under one percent
let that sink in for a minute under one
percent so less than
one percent of west africans have the
[ __ ] up version of the of the actin
and three gene right
so 99 of west africans
have the good version of that gene which
is insane because again the the global
average is like at least 18
should have it um if you look at
jamaicans who dominate sprint you know
uh spreading events same thing about two
percent
of the jamaican population have it uh if
you look at sprinters if
you look at sprinters it's not a single
sprinter in the world whereas the xx
version
you guys could look it up you know all
the top spinners in the world that all
have r
you know or or x now if you have xx
you more you know you're gonna dominate
in uh
endurance events right but don't even
don't even waste your time as far as uh
uh you know winning the 100 meter
dashboard so that is one of the primary
reasons
why black people dominate sprinting and
you know sports that require
a lot of fastest thing you know the
acting in three profile
is the best out of the entire [ __ ]
world
anyway next up my staten again
sub-saharan african so west african
central africa whatever they have the
highest uh mutations amongst that now
they're not missing the myostatin gene
right but they have the highest you know
uh cases of mystery and polymorphism
right so they have the highest variation
of the myostatin gene so that gives them
an advantage again when it comes to
building muscle
next the androgen receptor it's another
thing that you guys should know
uh black people also have um a very very
high
uh sensitivity to androgen receptors
right that's why a lot of them blow up
so fast on steroids
um that's also why they have the highest
rates of prostate cancer you know
prostate cancer is
mainly a function of a you know very
sensitive androgen receptor
all right so very sensitive to androgen
and receptors
um and obviously you guys know it's the
androgen receptor is the number one
predictive muscle growth right if you
if you had to pay just one thing that
would that decides how much muscle you
could put on or how fast you could put
on muscle
it's obviously your androgen receptor
and obviously you know uh you know
anorexia myostatin and things like that
which is why again that's why nucleus
works so [ __ ] well because when you
increase the amount of satellite cells
in your muscles the amount of nuclei
you're also increasing your androgen
receptors right next
anatomy right again being next to the
equator
right people that you know the fact that
west africans
uh have evolved next to the equator
gives them a huge advantage as far as
you know
the anatomy goes for those who are not
familiar with how
geographical location affects your
anatomy animals and humans
uh who evolve near the equator have
longer limbs like i mentioned earlier
um helps you with heat management right
they have narrower hips
and all those things make them really
good at sports you know that's why
now what does that have to do with
building muscle fast well think about it
for a second well if you're naturally
good at sports
because of you know your anatomy you're
gonna start playing sports from an early
age which is the case with most black
people that start playing some very
early age
and they accumulate a lot of satellite
cells a lot of nuclei
and when they start bodybuilding right
if you're familiar with my nucleus
overload
theory which is not proven so it's no
longer theory um
they accumulate a lot of satellite cells
from playing sports when playing soccer
playing basketball whatever so when they
start lifting of course they're going to
put on muscle faster than the average
person who didn't work out right they
have more satellite cells more nuclei
remember satellite cells are upregulated
uh from
physical activity especially if you're
doing it daily
that's why like i always say you know
people who used to train the traps daily
when they start bodybuilding
um their traps blow up people used to
play soccer or you should bike ride a
lot
you know their legs blow up when they
start bodybuilding so it's the same
effect
here you know most black people are
genetically
uh have a genetic advantage when it
comes to anatomy
and that puts them in situations where
they're playing sports from a very very
young age
so when it starts training a lot of the
growth you see is mainly as a response
of the
high satellite cell content accumulated
next sunlight
obviously watch my video on the vitamin
d that's why i'm so big on sunlight and
vitamin d right i hate calling the
vitamin d because it's a [ __ ] hormone
it's not a vitamin right your body makes
it
your body doesn't make vitamins it was
called vitamin d by mistake because it
was the fourth one discovered but it's a
hormone
i'm not gonna go into details watch my
videos i made a 30 minute video about
that but
i explained why i'm so big on sunlight
why i always saw people make sure you
get enough sunlight
but in short the benefits of vitamin d
is not just for calcium
yes calcium is important right calcium
gives you stronger bones
and obviously your muscles can't even
contract without calcium so obviously
if you have if you're vitamin d
deficient your muscles are going to suck
ass your bones are going to suck yes
but people keep forgetting that vitamin
d has receptors throughout the entire
body you know your muscle
your satellite cells have vitamin d
receptors so vitamin d is
amazing at not just retaining calcium
but at building muscle
in fact it is a prerequisite uh for
for building muscle you know it lowers
my statin
it increases your your proportion of fat
stress muscle fibers
on and so forth and guess what west
africans
are right there near the equator right
so they're getting plenty
plenty of sunlight remember your number
one source of vitamin d is the sun there
was no supplements back then when we
evolved
you know eons ago there was no vitamin d
supplements right and you're not going
to get it from your diet there's no
fortified cereals in africa or whatever
so you had to get it from the sun that's
why the sun is the number one source of
vitamin d
right and in fact that's why black
people have dark skin right
as a mechanism to prevent that skin
damage from
excessive uvb radiation now the
[ __ ] who left africa right went
to northern europe asia whatever
they had to evolve white skin because
guess what there's not enough uvb
radiation the further away you go from
the equator that's why
white skin evolved but long story short
you know the fact that west africans
evolved and adapted near the equator
plays a huge role in you know
their ability to put on muscle and the
genetic ability
to obviously have strong bones and be
good at sports and all that [ __ ]
and next you have culture right you also
have to look at the fact that you know
it's not just genetics it's also your
environment you know
culture um black people just you know
put a big emphasis on sports performance
you know i mean even in the projects
if you show up and say hey you know i
have uh you know
hey i want to be an engineer everyone
looks at you funny you're like what do
you want to be an engineer right
you know usually in most black
communities and you're not all black
communities but
in most lower income black communities
it's all about sports you're either
gonna play sports or basketball you know
nba or nfl
you're gonna be a rapper or [ __ ] gang
member
right those are the three things that
are [ __ ] worship you know and that's
one of my biggest issues with the black
community it's like we're literally
reinforcing we're literally putting um
all of our youngsters in situations
where they only have three things
to choose from now of course things are
changing you know winning 20 20 now i'm
thinking you know things are changing
um but culture plays it plays a huge
role you know when you grow up seeing
that michael jordan is you know
um on top of the world that makes more
black kids want to join
sports you know when you grow up seeing
that you know
i don't know the best bodybuilders black
you know that inspires you to try by the
building so culture plays
you know plays a huge role and your
social economic factors or another thing
you have to think about when you when
you talk about culture is
sexual selection right now not only you
have natural selection deciding what
genes are going to get past somebody you
also have sexual selection right what
women want or women like right
and like say if you grew up in the hood
right if you play sports
jesus christ [ __ ] were all over you
right
so the guy who's
jacked or who's good at i don't know you
know playing football or you know it's a
good point guard is a good running back
whatever
he's not going to have any issues
passing on his [ __ ] jeans
so that just perpetuates the whole you
know good gene thing it just keeps
getting passed on on and on and on it's
not gonna die at any time soon
and last but not least you also have the
illusion right when you have dark skin
you just look bigger right the darker
your skin is the more your definition
shows that's why bodybuilders 10 right
that's why even the widest bodybuilders
have to put on the tan before they go on
the show
so you also have the illusion factor so
in short these are the 10 reasons why
black people in quote
put on muscle so then fast all right so
conclusion it's a combination of
genetics in society
right it's a combination of
environmental factors socioeconomic
status
i mean think about it there's a lot of
white people who have really good
genetical building muscle but are
probably
lawyers or engineers or working as
doctors or some [ __ ] you know
um so you gotta look at you know
opportunities as well
the more opportunities is offered to a
group of people
the more the genetic pool is going to be
spread out you know and finally your
genetics are good enough right do not
use this video as an excuse
to say hey i'm not west african descent
and or whatever
so there's no hope in me building muscle
i just showed you that it's not
every west african so don't use that as
an excuse
most people have genetics good enough to
put on muscle in fact
if you take the average person if that
person maximizes the genetic potential
they're gonna look better
than the most genetically gifted west
african okay
so don't use it as an excuse in fact
most people have
good enough genetics it's just their
training success the nutrition success
right and once again i'm a perfect
example of that you know my genetics
with trash
after two years of lifting i still look
like [ __ ] and i thought hey maybe this
thing you know this thing is not for me
right but once i started doing full body
workouts back in 2012 once i started
focusing more on high frequency nucleus
overload all that stuff
i grew like a [ __ ] weed you know go
look at my videos back from 2012 to
2013. you know that was
that was years after my new games were
over but yet i was able to put on so
much muscle because i found out what
works
not just for me but for the majority of
nerdy [ __ ] right which is again
training more frequently so most people
train like trash
they eat like trash and they say oh you
know you know i just don't have to
you know get enough genetics no your
genetics are good enough they're not
top tier rodney coleman genetics but
they're good enough you just gotta fix
your training
you gotta fix your nutrition all right

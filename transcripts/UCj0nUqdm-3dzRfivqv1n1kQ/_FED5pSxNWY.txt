hey guys what's going on megan here
check out this guy's quads man
unbelievable a subscriber sent this to
me a while back and wanted me to make a
video on it
his legs are out of this world i mean
look at his calves
imagine if this guy decided to stop
bodybuilding by anyway guys this is
another episode of what the [ __ ]
wednesday where we just talk about
genetic freaks people that have
crazy body parts or impressive physiques
doesn't matter if they're natty
and hands or have myostatin deficiencies
all physiques matter
on this segment his name is joshua
tuisova he's a professional
rugby player and his weight is somewhere
between 240 and 250 pounds in fact he
bulked up to that way he was actually a
lot smaller when he first started
and he is obviously from fiji so as you
guys
know phaedrians are mixed with
melanesians and polynesians and they
also have some denisovan dna
but long story short this guy is an
absolute beast look at his
freaking quad development his calves
imagine if this guy had a milestone
efficiency i mean his lives would be out
of this world
there's another picture here i'll try to
find some good pictures online that are
very hard to find
a bunch of watermarks all over them and
[ __ ] but yeah extremely powerful legs
and if you watch a lot of his highlights
he is extremely fast he's really putting
those quads
to good use there goes a different
picture here from a different angle guys
look at this
his calves blow my mind now you guys
know i don't care about cavs but just
look at this cancerous growth now of
course his legs are way out of
proportion compared to his upper body
but remember guys he's a rugby player
he's not a bodybuilder he's not worried
about aesthetics
he's just worried about power output
so pretty much whatever gets the job
done combine that with the pacific
islander genetics
if you haven't already watch my video on
pacific islanders
and the result is an absolute unit and i
know what a lot of guys are going to say
steroids steroids blah blah
almost everyone at the top level um in
these sports uses pd's but yeah they
don't all look like this right so you
gotta factor in the genetic component
also keep in mind that their training is
pretty much nucleus overload on crack
every day is like day every day is
[ __ ] like day if you're a rugby
player
some days they focus on power movement
so squats and
cleans front squats some days they focus
on hypertrophy work so obviously higher
volume higher rep ranges
some days they focus on the stationary
bike and other stationary drills
which still contributes towards weekly
volume for legs
especially if you're doing it in hrt
format some days they focus on sprint
and other spade related drills
and obviously you gotta factor in game
day itself so these guys
their legs are always under stimulus
every single day
so you combine that with some freak
genetics and obviously
you know what it's not surprising that
you end up with
quads like that now of course not all of
them have this kind of lag development
but once again this is where genetics
comes in
by anyway this was supposed to be a very
quick video shout out to
azov for recommending this video
definitely more to come on those
freak of nature rugby players and their
ridiculous quads

come by

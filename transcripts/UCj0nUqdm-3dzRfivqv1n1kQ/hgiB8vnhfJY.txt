hey guys what's going on megan here why
are polynesians
you know samoans pretty much pacific
islanders
so damn jack and big
you know i mean these guys unless you've
been living under a rock
they get stupid bait you know and i'm
talking about all ships and sizes they
can't get super buff
they can't get bait for football rock
babies pretty much the same thing
they can get super fat if they want to
kind of like yokozuna if you grew up
loving wrestling like i did uh rikishi
umaga you name it i mean these guys have
some of the best genetics when it comes
to just putting on sauce you know
um even when they get fat even when they
get stupid fat they're still
very athletic and very very powerful
which is why the dominate you know
rugby and the nfl you know most of the
linebackers and
and uh most of the line men are pretty
much uh polynesians
now why is that why is it that they have
some of the best genetics
uh when it comes to just getting big in
general and don't worry it has nothing
to do with nucleus overload this time
all right so let's get to it so when you
hear me say samoans polynesia whatever
i'm putting them all in the same
category but just keep in mind if you
want to be technical
there's a lot of ethnic variety within
the groups but i'm mainly referring
to the people here right pacific
islanders
obviously the world is round so it goes
all the way here but pretty much these
are the people i'm referring to you know
polynesian so
the various islands in the pacific ocean
now why is it
that they're able to get so big enough
again for those who don't know
you are 40 to 50 times right up to 50
times
likely to be in the nfl if you have
samoan parents
that's insane guys they are such a small
tiny tiny percentage of the population
yet if you samoan
if you have someone parents right you
are 40 to 50 times likely to be an nfl
that's insane these guys have amazing
genetics uh for getting big but um
and like i said not just as big as in
like oh sloppy wait no these
guys can get super big put on a lot of
fat a lot of muscle and be athletic at
the same time
i say growing up you guys remember
rikeshi you know even when he was fat as
hell this guy was so athletic you know
my god rest in peace you guys remember
the rock even when he was young this guy
looked like he was a [ __ ] like he was
like 35 years old
i mean these guys get big and athletic
and there's also studies that were done
on their body composition
which shows that they have that on a
pound for pound basis so even
if you take a fat samoan and a fat white
person or
fat uh asian or whatever the samoans and
polynesians
have way more power output and their
body composition is more geared towards
power
there are some of the strongest people
on earth now what let's get to it right
reason number one
obviously genetics right you always got
a factor in genetics
um they actually have a gene polynesians
actually have a gene
um that is almost non-existent in the
rest of the world population
so the majority of africans don't have
it a majority of europeans and asians
don't have it
but over 50 percent of pollinators have
it right and it's a gene that pretty
much allows them to store
fat much easier than everybody else
right they're able to stop fat
with much less energy so pretty much it
cost them less to store fat right so
if you're trying to get two people fat
let's say they're they're identical in
almost everything but one person has
that gene
you give them the same caloric surplus
the person with that gene is gonna put
on
fat faster and more efficiently than the
other person
they've done experiments but they
actually they literally took rats which
is [ __ ] sad
they took rats and they took uh
obviously you have the control group you
know that was just uh
normal genes and the other grad they're
pretty much
engineered to have that you know that
gene and sure enough
uh given the same uh caloric surplus the
the rest of the gene were able to put on
fat much faster right so
obviously genetics play a role right now
of course you still got to be in the
cleric surplus it's not like they define
the laws of physics right you know
they're not
they're not getting fat by being in a
deficit right that's not how it works
it's just
that gene makes it easier for them to
start fat now you might ask why why you
know why did they evolve to have that
gene well simple you know like i said
it's always going to come down to
natural selection you know if you watch
my video on
uh why black people build muscle faster
and blah blah
well not all black people but like i
said watch the video i'll go into
details there but i explained there you
know it's all about natural selection
right you always got to look at
the history of the people and you know
how to adapt it to their to the
environment
of course if you know polynesians if you
have a daughter you definitely watch
moana but you know if you took basic
history classes
you know polynesians were some of the
greatest sailors in history right these
guys
colonize the you know most of the
pacific ocean which is
massive i mean the the map doesn't do
justice you know as far as how big and
how fast
the pacific ocean is but yeah so these
guys colonize the majority of the
pacific ocean
well once a majority but a big chunk of
it and
you can clearly see why that gene came
in handy right because think about it
these guys were i see
for long periods of time weeks months
who was going to survive
and pass on the dream think about it so
if you take two guys one is skinny
one is uh you know one doesn't have the
ability to put on fat easy
and then the other guy has the ability
to get fat as [ __ ]
given the same caloric surplus who do
you think is going to survive
you know a long-ass journey at sea
right obviously the fat person right the
person was able to put on a lot of fat
while they on you know while they're on
the island before they actually go out
of sea
that person is going to survive uh the
journey it's just common [ __ ] sense
right
yes being bigger means you also burn
more calories but eventually your body
your metabolism adapts so the skinny guy
he's burning less calories at first
but ultimately he runs out of stores and
[ __ ] dies
the fat guy is going to start burning a
lot of calories at first because it's
obviously bigger
but over time his body is going to down
regulate his metabolism
and he's going to be able to survive
because he just has so much fat on him
so having that gene so whoever had the
mutation to have that gene
they had a genetic advantage right they
had an advantage and they were able to
survive their long journeys
and once they're landing on an island
whatever that guy was able to
pass on his genes so it's just natural
selection right it's one of the reasons
why
um over 50 of polynesians have this gene
and the rest of the world is pretty much
[ __ ] non-existent
it allowed them to survive long long
periods of time without food
now sadly right this gene is also one of
the reasons why they have the highest
obesity rates in the whole [ __ ] world
you know the highest obesity rates are
found here all these islands
you know it's crazy obesity rates and
and that's just what happens when
uh the environment changes faster than
your dreams can keep up right because
now they have that gene
right over half of them have that dream
but they don't
[ __ ] eat it right they're not at sea
they're not starving right so now
it's literally so much easier for them
to get fat given the fact that they're
not as active as they used to be
and you know the whole process food bs
whatever
but anyway the second reason is
obviously
the culture war right you cannot
separate war from human evolution right
polynesians had to fight a lot i mean
what happens when you finally
colonize a small island right and you
have limited resources
who do you think is going to be able to
dominate the area
right the guys who are more vicious the
guys who are stronger who are faster who
are bigger
obviously right if you look throughout
the animal kingdom
size wins fights so the bigger guys not
only
not only by being bigger they were able
to survive the journey but now they have
an advantage
when it comes to holding resources right
and the polynesians
were amazing warriors they take pride in
the fact that they were amazing warriors
right
um if you watch the rugby team i [ __ ]
love when i do the hakka
i know a lot of you guys don't watch
rugby but it's such an epic display of
power and intimidation
i remind you to do that with my daughter
when she was little we should literally
do the hakka
and keep in mind even though the mario
are known for most known for the hakka a
lot of polynesians have that one version
but anyway yeah so you have wall that's
one of the second reasons why
they're so big right the bigger guy once
you get on an island
the bigger guy was gonna have an
advantage with wall an advantage in
combat right
and so now they're to be able to pass on
their genes and have the most women and
things
on and so forth and you see this happen
a lot whenever you have
scarce resources such as on a small
island
the bigger people tend to have an
advantage as far as reproduction goes
same thing with animals so if your
ancestor was polynesian chances are your
ancestor was a big buff dude you know
and he obviously passed on those genes
to your punk ass now the third reason
obviously comes down to food right they
have a culture
that actually glorifies food these guys
love to eat you know to them
you know it's it's not a bad thing you
know to them food is good
you know they actually encourage uh you
know to eat a lot
because like i said you know being
bigger man you were a better warrior at
the time and
you were able to survive the long
journeys so
a lot of that culture has been passed
down throughout the generations
these guys eat a ton you know that's
mainly again
you know a lot of fish a lot of coconuts
obviously bananas
roots things like that but having a
culture that emphasizes
um food so much that actually glorifies
food
what it does is even if you are born
without this gene here that allows you
to store fat
or even if you were born without the
ability to get to but you know without
the ability to get too big
you're still going to eat a lot because
it's just the culture
a lot of those habits just get copied
you know if you're a kid then you see
your parents always eating chances are
you also gonna
get a lot as you get older so you have
three things that combine
um to make polynesians and samoans and
things like that
so [ __ ] soul you have genetics the
fact that they were amazing sellers
you have the war culture right the fact
that those warrior dreams were passed on
you know
the bigger guy had all the women and the
resources and i received the culture
right the fact that they actually
glorified eating
and the rock just got lucky i'm gonna do
a video on the rock cause he just got
lucky you know he
he inherited samoan jeans and the bbc
genetics
from his father so there's a whole video
on the rock coming soon just stay tuned
for that but anyway
conclusion how can you apply this to
your life well number one
like i always say it's all about
evolution right it's all about genetics
it's all about natural selection right
you want to know the difference between
people whether it's difference in skin
color
behavior size blah blah blah it's always
going to boil down to genetics
second thing to keep in mind is that it
still comes down to caloric surpluses
right you want to get big you still got
to eat big
you could have the best genetics in the
world for putting on size
but at the end of the day you got to be
in the surplus to pack on size
and it's sad that i have to repeat that
because you'd be amazed at how many
skinny guys
you know are desperately trying to keep
their their their six
back while at the same time saying well
i don't understand why i'm not getting
big and i'm like dude you're eating like
[ __ ]
1500 calories a day you know so genetics
are not
steroids or not you still gotta eat yes
the genetics make it easier
for you to get big um yes obviously the
steroids play a role obviously a lot of
these guys obviously on the juice
but you still got to be in a surplus and
that boils down to number three as well
right
if you're trying to lose fat if you're
samoan or you you know again polynesian
and you're trying to lose fat don't
blame the genetics don't say well you
know i have genetics that make me store
fat you know
blah blah yes it simply means that it's
going to be harder for you to go on a
diet
but the laws of physics still apply
right you still got to find a way
you know to create that deficit
you don't have to eat less you could
just move more you could exercise more
you could increase your daily activity
but anyway without making this video too
long that's the reason why
polynesians are able to get so big and
so powerful at the same time

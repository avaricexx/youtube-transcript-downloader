hey guys what's going on megan here so
check out this guy
i can't stop laughing each time i look
at it but this is the kid from the
mondays video might stand
check out how jack days keep in mind
he's only 10 years old 10 year old kid
from vietnam with a my stand efficiency
right aka the hercules gene
look at his neck look look at his calves
like this kid
is so jacked at only 10 years of age
and now you see why i'm obsessed with my
stat and why i love studying the
molecule it just does the most
ridiculous things
keep in mind this kid hasn't gone
through puberty yet normal testosterone
levels
normal daily activities the only
difference is he's lacking the mind
strategy
anyway this is another episode of what
the [ __ ] wednesday where we just talk
about
various genetic freaks whether they're
on roy's or not it doesn't matter right
people that just have
uh outside of the norm physiques now
more info on this kid
so he's from vietnam 10 years of age and
obviously again he has a milestone
efficiency his parents found that out
when he was about six years old even
when he was born the doctor noticed
there was something unusual
usually when you're born with a my
standard efficiency doctors pick it up
at birth right they notice that the kid
has
unusual size in his biceps calves things
like that so
he's not the first case at all and i'm
pretty sure i don't have to explain it
again but there's always someone in the
comments section saying what is my
satin long story short i've made a bunch
of videos about it going back
uh the last 10 years to check them out
but long story short it's a gene that
inhibits muscle growth and that's the
body's way of stopping us from just
growing forever because obviously from
an evolutionary perspective
uh muscle growth is expensive i say that
over and over again that's why you got
to eat so much food to maintain a
broad-like physique you know having too
much muscle on you too expensive your
heart has to work harder
and it's obviously not ideal from an
endurance standpoint in humans we
actually evolved as
as an endurance space species primarily
so myostatin pretty much does the
opposite of what we all want so
it increases body fat increases insulin
resistance
and it obviously stops muscle growth so
when you're lacking my satin
uh you have the reverse right you have
very very low body fat
extreme muscle mass and obviously better
insulin sensitivity
and here we go some more pictures look
at his calves look at his calves
compared to the other kid in the back
and again remember these guys are about
the same age
and the kid doesn't even train he tried
to train with a bodybuilder for about
three months and went right back home
because he was homesick
so this is all genetics look at his
traps back here
unreal on [ __ ] rail he has bigger
traps than
99 of us who are doing shrugs and
dead lifts and everything under the sun
you have another picture here
look at his biceps the only issue that
he's very very stiff
very very stiff um so his parents have
him do a lot of stretching and stuff
like that
another one here look at his delts oh my
god with the [ __ ]
lighting from the gods look at his
doubts guys [ __ ]
popping out side laterals not even once
another picture here shoulders biceps
back double bye baby darling yates in
the house
this one here again he wants to be a
bodybuilder another one here where it's
flexing his traps
and his neck his neck drops me insane he
looks like [ __ ] bikey the grappler
guys he has that football neck
more rhomboid made trapezius action but
anyway here's the interesting guy so
this kid wants to be about it right so
imagine
he decides to become an rbb pro right
again obviously you guys know
i always recommend a natural route but
again let's say he decides to go
the enhanced ride he wants to be an ipv
pro so this is how he looks now before
puberty writes now imagine what he would
look like
if he actually took the usual you know
bodybuilder cycle
so take that physique add some tests add
some d
ball add some 19 notes so nandrolono
tran whatever
add a dhc derivative so primo master on
whatever and just for the [ __ ] of a
summary finding some growth hormones so
right
look how he looks down now imagine how
this kid would look if he had all of
these
[ __ ] anabolic compounds into his body
after puberty and let's say 18 19 20
years old
he would be bigger than ronnie bigger
than big ramy
bigger than thorian bigger than uh every
mass monster that
ever walked is that insane guys the fact
that he looks like this without any of
these compounds blows my [ __ ] mouth
and as i explained in a previous video
the mystery and pathway is
far more anabolic than any other pathway
in human body that includes testosterone
that includes
estrogen that includes every single
igf-1 you name it
the myostatin pathway alone is more
anabolic than all these other pathways
combined because again keep in mind this
kid has normal levels of testosterone
he's not even going through puberty yet
and yeah he looks like this right that
just goes to show
that my stand is the future of
bodybuilding you know it's been almost
over two decades now and scientists are
still trying to find a way to uh
to find the most powerful mystic
inhibitors so long story short this kid
has
the true hercules gene a lot of people
confuse that with what uh
eddie hall has so what eddie jorge has
got you understand so you have two
copies of each gene
you get one from your mom won't give me
that so what this kid has is a
deficiency meaning
his body doesn't produce mass that at
all it's a very very very rare mutation
because
in order for you to be deficient in it
your mom has to lack um
a proper version of the master energy in
half of her jeans and your dad also has
to have
the lacking version in the other half
and obviously when they come together he
claps the cheeks
you got to inherit the mutated version
of the gene
from both parents that's why it's so
rare i mean it's it's
extremely rare to end up with that what
eddie hall has his body still produces
my statin
it's just he has a mutation where it
doesn't produce as much as the average
person you have many many kinds of
master mutations
so there's a big difference between
lacking the mystery and gene altogether
which is what this kid has
and i'm only producing small amounts or
a less effective version of the gene so
to be specific addie hall actually has
half of the mutation in layman's terms
that's why he didn't look like that as a
kid
the best thing we could do as nadis is
again watch my last video
is to train right resistance training is
the number one most effective way to
lower my stat
so that's the best thing that we can do
as normal
uh non x-men non-mutants it's just lift
weights right
average reduction in myostatin is about
40 percent from weightlifting
it goes as high as 70 80 depending on
how trained you are
the only drawback is the reduction we
get in my style and after training
peaks at about eight hours and then goes
back to baseline around the 24 hour mark
which is why again protein genesis peaks
at about 24 hours if you're naughty
right because you get this huge drop in
myostatin which allows your body to grow
and again it peaks around the eight hour
mark and then goes right back towards
baseline to start [ __ ] your [ __ ] up
again
so as an addie best thing we could do is
just train frequently as long as we
manage recovery of course
meanwhile this kid can just exist and
constantly have uh you know
zero margin but anyway guys that's it
this was another episode of what the
[ __ ] wednesday
big shout out to this kid and i really
hope uh he becomes something great
he has no health issues so far apart
from the usual stiffness
um but hopefully his health doesn't get
worse because in animals they tend to
have some issues as they get older

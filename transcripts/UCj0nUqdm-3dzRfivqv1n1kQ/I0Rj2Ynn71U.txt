all right guys what's going on Megan
here this is the footage from last week
doing a collab with PG there goes big J
there Jim um we started off with side
laterals standing pretty lightweight
just to get how short as warm up then we
moved on to seated side laterals and big
just showed us these crazy techniques I
want to make separate videos cuz he
showed us so many techniques on this
today that they can't all fit in one
video I'm going to make a video for each
technique but we moved on to see the
side laterals when our rotat cuffs and
shoulders are warmed up
and
um and after that we moved on to uh
heavy C side leral it's the same
exercise just did different techniques
Guided by Big J um this one was the last
one we had to go as heavy as possible
and just you know cheat so pretty much
we start up for good form and then as we
get heavier and heavy heavier we just
start cheating to you know overload
muscle goes the last
[Music]
one and um yeah he pretty much show us
how you could just use one exercise and
do so many different techniques instead
of of you know wasting time trying to
separate or break down your exercises
anyway we moved on to presses obviously
you got to start with your warm up um we
did a few light
presses big
J moved on to heavier presses as you can
tell
here I really like his his um his
Approach at LIF thing because based on
his experience he knows about injuries
and how to prevent them and things like
that it's really really big on starting
with lightweights until you warmed up
before you move on to your heav your
weight which we all do um subconsciously
but you know he's really really big on
that I can see why the amount of weight
that uh we ended up moving we had to
warm
[Applause]
up I was pretty happy for me all right
Big J's turn making it look
easy and after that we'll be doing the
slap City presses which is actually the
funniest part of the entire
workout you'll see
I think
need oh Slap City okay yeah big telling
matter about Slap City you are you ready
for it he's like yeah man Bring it on

we have fun with the
presses we start the light and we went
heavy squeeze at the top all kinds of
techniques you know out of one shoulder

body hair right chest hair back hair
things like that I'm going to put that
amazing it's a very good predictor of
testosterone levels mainly because it
works even after puberty even after
puberty if you get castrated somebody
cuts your balls off yeah your testest
levels will plummet and your body hair
will also drop second reason why it's
ranked higher is because yes it does
follow a dose response relationship with
testosterone right if you inject women
with a crap ton of testosterone some of
them will start growing by here uh the
reason why it's not high again because
obviously to St in the Androgen receptor
and not the so drivers right there's
also genetics there's DHT five reductors
polymorphisms things like that

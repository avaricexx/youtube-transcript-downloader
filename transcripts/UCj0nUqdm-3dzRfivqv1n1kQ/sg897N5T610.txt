hey guys what's going on megan here top
tier tuesday
and someone requested hey megan since we
all like combat sports and we also like
bodybuilding
why not make a top tier list based on
the best physiques
out of all mma champions and i was like
you know what it's a great idea but i'm
not gonna do all champions they're just
way too many
so let's just focus on the bigger guys
right so we're gonna do a top tier
tuesday
ranking the physiques of all the ufc
heavyweight champions maybe in the
future we might do the lower classes but
anyway so you guys are familiar with the
chair list
you got the i'm about to not category
which is obviously best of the best
[ __ ] amazing okay bad and pure
garbage
now keep in mind when i was coming up
with these names we're just ranking
items like
food and exercises and [ __ ] like that
right this was not designed
for straight [ __ ] but obviously we're
gonna have to make exceptions from now
on so
give me a break with the no homo
[ __ ] you know what the [ __ ] i mean
i'm about to not it's just an expression
me and my friends used to use a lot when
something was really
really [ __ ] good usually food or
whatever and it just stuck
right so that does not mean that we're
trying to nut on [ __ ] ufc
fighters all right because i know
somebody's gonna go in the comments
section and point that out
all right let's get started keep in mind
the pictures that we're using here i
just pick random pictures online right
so some of them are gonna be at their
best someone i'm not gonna be at the
worst
and also this is just for fun guys um i
know it's not a fair list because a lot
of these guys
come from before the crackdown era where
they were very very lenient or steroid
usage
so obviously they're going to have
better physiques compared to the newer
guys
who are obviously still jews but not to
the same mixture alright so let's get
started who has the best physique from a
bodybuilding perspective
obviously more muscle doesn't mean
better performance than ufc but like i
said this is just for fun
all right so we're gonna put andre at
he actually had a pretty good physique
um
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm gonna put in my
[ __ ] amazing right look really good
next kane we're gonna play kane believe
it or not i'm gonna put k n out okay
right about irish build
uh compared to the rest of these guys
right this is not compared to the
average person
or compared to ronnie coleman is
compared to these ufc physiques
all right next come on pure garbage come
on you know you were going down there
pure garbage um next oh my god you guys
already know where he's going
cole man is going in i'm about to knock
category
again he was rewarded out of his mind
but we don't give a [ __ ]
this list is just for fun next fabricio
we're gonna put him
at i'm gonna put him at [ __ ] that's
tough
i wanna put him out okay up there with
kane frank same thing right frank was
pretty jacked
again compared to harris person but
again on this list
i'm gonna put him out okay right i'm
gonna put him out okay next josh
that's a tough one man i'm gonna put
joshua bad i don't know man i'm just
not a big fan of that physique dos
santos i'm actually gonna put him at
[ __ ] amazing right he actually had a
pretty uh
pretty good physique so he's going up
there uh
kevin is definitely definitely going in
the i'm about to nut category in the
right out of my mind category brock
lesnar you guys already know
and i know it's not because i'm biased
towards mass monsters even though i am
and no it's not because
i grew up loving wwe um
he just looks [ __ ] impressive man now
obviously later on in his career his
physique started deteriorating but
that's almost everybody but anyway
uh brock at his prom i would say i'm
about to not right it's not even close
monster traps team no neck you guys
already know those are the most alpha
muscles in the human body
all right a smith maybe somewhere
between okay and bad i'm gonna put in my
bad if i put
josh down here i gotta be fair i'm gonna
put smith um at least in this picture
down here uh steve i'm not just going to
put my
uh damn i'm gonna put my [ __ ] amazing
but like
you know in the back right not up there
because his physique is
good enough to be above okay but not uh
significantly higher than those guys uh
next you guys have francis you guys
already know
i'm about to not category but he's
obviously gonna be back here right
because
the guys in front of him were way more
jacked
randy believe it or not i'm gonna put
randy out [ __ ] amazing in fact i'm
gonna put him in front of all these guys
right part of it is probably because i'm
also biased
i really really like randy um but uh
i just think his physique is sick right
obviously if you had a lot more mass
they'll definitely be and i'm about to
another category but
randy's definitely in [ __ ] amazing
category rico rico come on man you know
you're going to pure garbage i'm sorry
man
and again this is compared to those guys
right i'm pretty sure he still looks
better than the average person
but come on compared to these guys i
gotta put you down here boss is a tough
one but i'm gonna put him out okay
uh [ __ ] i want to put him higher but uh
damn this is a tough one i'm gonna put
it okay but like you know
in the top range and last but not least
nah [ __ ] that last and least
i'm gonna put tim at pure garbage

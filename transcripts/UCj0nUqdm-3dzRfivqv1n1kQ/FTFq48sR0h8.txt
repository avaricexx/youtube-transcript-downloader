all right guys what's up team 3D I want
to show you guys how to make a quick
sauce quick you know you guys know I
love peas so it's going to be a quick
Pea sauuce only takes a few minutes as
you'll need olive oil garlic actually
garlic powder black pepper salt tomato
paste you can use any seasoning of your
choice for these two all right you also
need a big ass pot you need brine
chicken for this specific recipe I
actually brine this overnight watch my
video on how to brine chicken breast I'm
going to put it I love doing this this
is so cool I want to put it right there
I love you too so after you brine it
make sure you drain it
out now I chopped it up in small pieces
for one reason uh it Cooks a lot faster
you're going to turn your stove on
you want to have it on Med on
medium in the beginning all right first
thing you want to do is you want to use
some of your olive
oil by the way H is the cameram man
today so shout out to H blame him me if
anything goes wrong in the video quality
all right guys next step once the oil is
getting a little hot you don't want to
wait till it it's too hot cuz it's olive
oil you want to put some of the tomato
paste up in here
so one
[Music]
two now it depends on how much how much
of this actually want to make I think
two two is good enough well let's make
it two and A2 oh
[ __ ] and you want to kind of mix it
in in the oil do this for about 30 30 45
seconds when it start oh [ __ ] my bad
though move back when it start jumping
up and down and [ __ ] it's when you want
to put the chicken
in ready it's going to Splash
not there throw the chicken
in start
mixing start
mixing you want to put your fire on
really really high right now want to put
your stove on really
high and just mix you want to coat the
chicken with
the with the tomato paste and the olive
oil do this for about 30 seconds
after 30 seconds you want to add your
seasoning garlic
powder ner
pepper and some
salt
ah just keep mixing it you don't want
the chicken to stick to the bottom in
fact that's what that's what um the
olive oil is
for one of the reasons why it's in
[Music]
there all right after a few seconds once
you coated the chicken with the tomato
paste the olive oil and the seasoning
you want to cover it up
for just a few seconds until the chicken
changes color but you you don't want it
to burn all right you don't want the
chicken to actually stick to the bottom
like I said that's what the olive oil is
for leave it in there for a while wait
till the chicken goes from raw looking
to like a little cook and we're going to
go to the next step all right guys while
it's waiting while it's heating up while
it's the chicken is um slowly cooking
make sure the stove is on full blast you
want to open it up and make sure nothing
is staking look inside want to make sure
the chicken is not sticking to the
bottom in this case everything is
looking great it smells great the
chicken is actually getting smaller
because the water is leaving and it's
not sticking to the bottom so the olive
oil is doing its job awesome just keep
doing that and close it back
up all right guys next up you're going
to grab your green peas we get our from
um Kroger or Walmart cheaper version all
taste the
same you want to throw it
in throw it
in and you want to coat the green peas
can I see want to coat the green peas
with the mixure with the chicken and the
the sauce and all that stuff and we're
about to add some water but first we
want to coat everything right coat
you're going to notice the sizzling
sound goes down cuz uh the change of
temperature from
Frozen to
hot now at this stage you want to add
some
water and first throw in one cup of
water mix it
around now the amount of water you're
going to put in depends on how much you
make and I write this like this is for
two people so we're going to add water
based on that
but it depends on the amount
of uh footage
making mix it around you want to make
sure the peas are completely soak now
it's a good time to taste to see if it's
too salty or not salty enough if it's
too salty you add some water if it's not
salty enough you add some salt why it's
not a good time to do it cuz I don't
want to get burnt that's why I didn't do
it earlier now it's a good time because
you put the frozen peas in so it's like
a mixture of
Frozen um temperature hot temperature
so took a deep breath I got burn so many
times doing this [ __ ] ah like a
man
perfect perfect I'm not lying it's
actually perfect it's not too salty it's
not under flavored it's great just
perfect team 3D what do you
expect mix it around
and then cover it up leave it for a bit
leave the Fire On High by the way leave
the FR on high we're going to cut it
down in a in a little while all right
guys after about 15 20 minutes uh look
inside when you notice the water is
going down and it's still not sticking
to the bottom which is perfect you want
to turn down the the stove so like
really low as if you were making rice
show them show them how low this [ __ ]
see really
low and then you just want to cover it
up and just wait a few more minutes and
then it's almost done
okay all right
guys food is
done what the final result should be
like chicken fully
cooked not too much water freaking
delicious I wish you guys could smell
this I just took a taste to make sure
the chicken was fully cooked it's
amazing all right guys uh hope that
helps try it out you only need a few
ingredients doesn't cost a lot doesn't
take a lot to make less than an hour I
think 30 to 45 minutes just make sure
you Bry your chicken beforeand otherwise
it's going to be really dry and [ __ ] all
right a y me and H were talking about
this earlier you know I got to show you
like I'm cooking channels and [ __ ] this

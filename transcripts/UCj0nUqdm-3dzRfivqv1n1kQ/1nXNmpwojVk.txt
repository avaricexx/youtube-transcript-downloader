hey guys what's going on megan here the
video is finally out
why chasing the pump bill's muscle
faster than chasing strength and
i'm going to back up every single point
with nothing but facts
screw your feelings studies are going to
be in the description
every single thing i'm going to mention
in this video is going to be prove
the fn so no opinions here straight
facts all right
bodybuilder today is jay cutler one of
my favorite mr olympias of all time
he had some massive massive shoulders i
remember back in 2009 i
dreamt of having shoulders like that
obviously we're not going to hit that as
nadis but
they serve as great motivation all right
first let's knock out some myths alright
let's start with some myth busting
number one volume is the number one
driver hypertrophy period if you haven't
watched my video on progressive overload
and stronger is not bigger i suggest you
check those out
but i'm not gonna go into detail to keep
the video short volume is the drive of
hypertrophy
not mechanical tension right in fact
it's the volume
of mechanical tension that decides uh
your hypertrophy your load is irrelevant
so how much weight on the ball is
irrelevant
if you train hard enough meaning if you
train as close as failure as possible
you don't have to go to complete
positive failure but as long as you're
trained heavy enough and close enough to
failure
it doesn't matter what red print you're
using i've been talking about this for
years but now there are so many studies
to back it up you can look them up
yourself you know when i made the video
about that back in i think 2012 2013
i didn't have any studies i didn't need
any studies it's common sense um number
two progressive overlord is the result
of hypertrophy you gotta understand that
guys
people think that i'm against because
that's nonsense right
i'm against how it's misapplied right
it's too much shitty advice on the
internet telling people that they have
to go hit pls every day in order to
build muscle
or they have to be super [ __ ] strong
you know to build muscle which is bs
right progressive overload is a result
of hypertrophy as you get bigger you get
stronger it's not the other way around
right so stronger is not bigger bigger
and stronger period
right the bigger guys are strong because
they are big if you need further proof
of that think about powerlifting the
reason why you have weight glasses and
power lifting
is because the bigger you are you
automatically have an advantage over the
rest of the competition
it's not a coincidence next progressive
overload is the result of training
experience the longer you've been
training and when i say progressive all
over here i'm referring to strength
because that's usually what most people
you know
um attributed to so the longer you've
been training the stronger you are again
period that's the fact right so the
reason why somebody who's benching 400
has a bigger chest
right simply because he's been training
for god damn long right so i hate that
horrible comparison people make in my
comment section all the time they say
what megan the person who has
a 300 pound bench is gonna have a bigger
chest than the one who has a 90 pound
bench no [ __ ] [ __ ] the guy with
a 300 pound bench has been training for
goddamn years
right so you gotta understand your
strength is mostly based on neural
adaptations you know leverages and
things like that
but progressive overlord is the result
of transparency the longer you train
eventually you're gonna have to increase
the weight
right that's why i tell people if i say
pick a weight and do 20 reps
eventually you're gonna have to increase
that weight because after a while your
body's going to adapt to the 20 reps
and then when you reach 20 you're not
going to get a pump and you're going to
realize you have like 10 more reps left
in the tank
so instead of endlessly increasing the
reps you can simply increase the weight
to make the workout more challenging but
notice how you you progressively
overloading
because you adapted right so the
adaptation process comes first
then you increase the weight right so
don't go to the gym thinking oh my god
i have to lift more weight than last
time i'm not gonna grow that's freaking
nonsense the
fifth thing is you gotta understand guys
recruiting and fatiguing your fast
twitch muscles
is all that matters when you're trying
to build muscle right you already know
you have slow twitch muscles fast switch
muscles you have low threshold units
you have high threshold units right you
want to target those high threshold
motor units right they're the ones that
control the fibers that are the most
responsive to growth the ones that are
going to grow the most
how do you do that you could live heavy
right if you live heavy obviously your
body has to
recruit the high threshold motor units
or you could do high repetitions to
failure again when i said to failure it
means
you know you don't have to kill yourself
but like leaving at least one or two
reps in a tank
all right now that we understand that
let's get straight to the video the top
three forms of pump trading right so
number one you have katsu obviously
right
blood flow restriction training
occlusion training you know it goes by
many different names but
you gotta understand where it came from
it originally in the 1960s
by this guy here yoshiyaki sato he's the
legend
that pretty much destroyed all the myths
on heavy lifting and all that [ __ ]
right
back in the 60s and sure enough of
course the scientific community didn't
want to listen to him at first
and now there are over 600 studies
backing up you know uh you know blood
flow restriction training you know it's
changing the world every continent you
go to every
expert will tell you you know it is
literally game changing
and it's nothing new it's just that
people don't want to talk about it
because it crushes their ego
but anyway so he uh created back in
1960s um
but you don't have to put stuff on your
arms to get the same effect right that's
why i call it pump training because you
can really get the same effect through
drop sets
rust balls you know those are my top
three ways to maximize the pump
you could do drop sets you could do rust
balls or you could just do katsu right
before how did i discover this is when i
was doing my research on nucleus
overload when i was trying to understand
why is it that high rep worked so well
you know because back then like i said
at the time
it was all about oh you gotta live heavy
you gotta live heavy you gotta get
stupid strong
all right right [ __ ] right and i was
like wait that goes against nuclear solo
because people are making insane gains
doing
high rate push-ups high rep pull-ups you
know
why what's happening you know and
eventually that's when i stumbled upon
this and
boom you know i was mind-blown all right
so let's go into the reasons number one
fastest recorded growth ever the fastest
recorded growth
on humans right is with blood flow
restriction training that's not a
coincidence right
and here are some numbers there you can
see results as early as two weeks
depending on the training status whereas
when you're using typical heavy lifting
it normally takes about eight to twelve
weeks to see significant results
um one example here is you got 37
growth in 16 weeks that that is like one
of the best growth that we've seen
with traditional heavy lifting and those
were higher responders that had some of
the best genetics
whereas in katsu we saw 40 growth in
only two and a half weeks
right and it wasn't swelling because the
researchers are not stupid actually
waited until the swelling went down
so they can you know focus only on on
muscle growth and that's how you see
insane
um of course if you train you know
you're not going to get 40
in three weeks but you're still gonna
get more than if you're doing
traditional heavy lifting and the reason
is simple um
you're getting the same protein
synthesis as heavy lifting right but
you're getting less muscle damage a lot
less muscle damage which means you could
recover faster
meaning you could trade more frequently
right remember like the trading
frequency
is mainly dictated by how fast you
recover from muscle damage
so less damage faster recovery more
frequency means more volume and of
course
volume is the number one driver of
hypertrophy so the more volume you could
do at the end of the week
um theoretically the higher your growth
response next
the pump is the second biggest predictor
of muscle growth the first biggest
predictor is obviously testosterone
right your androgen receptor
uh density the more energetic receptors
you have that's the number one predictor
of how much muscle you could put on any
program um so the pump is actually
based on correlations the second biggest
predictor meaning at the end of your
workout
right they looked at the pump at
different stages 10 minutes after
five minutes after 30 minutes after
workout whatever and
the the swelling the pump that you have
10 minutes after your workout accounts
for 36 percent of the hypertrophy you're
gonna put on
at the end of your workout program right
whether it's eight weeks six weeks
whatever
which is ridiculous guys that is much
higher than the correlation between
strength
and size and it's like i'm telling you
guys strength and size are not
[ __ ] equal in fact strength is not
even one of the top five predictors of
muscle growth bet you didn't know that
right because you keep listening to
shitty advice
so muscle swelling post workout has a
bigger effect on how much
muscle you're gonna put on then all
these other factors that you guys
thought was important
and again uh i made videos in the past
about how uh
you know at the time it was bro science
because i'd have studies behind it how
the muscles that grew the fastest on me
all the people that are trying to work
with
were the ones that we had the most
insane pumps on you know we would like
literally pick up a weight and then the
muscle would just blow up especially the
muscles that we didn't include silver
load on
it was very very easy to get a pump on
those and it will also grow
extremely fast contrary to that the
muscles that we all had
issues growing and that's everyone that
i work with including myself
were the ones that we could not get good
pumps in for whatever reason
but at the time when i made a video of
course i didn't have studies i was like
hey guys it's just bro science but
this is what i noticed and i'm not the
only one a lot of people have noticed
that as well a lot of the muscles that
we can't grow we just simply can't get
it pumping
that could be due to activation and
things like that but
you know studies are not backing it up
and this study is extremely new and i
can't wait for more follow-up studies on
that
next you get extremely low muscle damage
doing bfl
or you know pretty much spun training
and again like i said little to no
damage means faster protein genesis
lower protein breakdown right so meaning
it's faster for you to go back to break
even
because remember if you have too much
damage guys that's what people forget
damage is fine
but excessive damage is bad why because
your body first has to waste its
resources
to repair the damage breaking you
bringing you back to break even
then it starts to build muscle right
again studies are backing that up guys
so if you do too much muscle damage your
body's gonna
waste the first few days that are
supposed to be spent on protein
sentences
your body's gonna spend that time just
recovering damage so really you're just
going back to break even
before the the growth fighter should
begin so you don't want to excessive
muscle damage and that's one of the
reasons why
bfr katsu builds so much muscle in such
a short amount of time because you're
getting all the protein synthesis
but the protein breakdown is so much
lower and also because you have less
muscle damage guys
y'all remember too much muscle damage
makes it harder for you to recruit
high threshold motor units you know
those high threshold fibers that grow
the most
so if you have too much damage very it's
going to be very hard to recruit them
but with tattoo because you have
low muscle damage it's actually easy to
recruit those which is why you could
train more frequently
and again that's going to lead to more
weekly value and which is the number one
driver hypertrophy
next extremely fast recovery goes back
to the previous slides
faster recovery you could train multiple
times a day meaning you're getting more
pulses and those anabolic factors you
know igf-1 growth hormone you know
lactate all the things
that stimulate growth you understand
have a very short half-life
so the more frequently you train better
that's why nucleus although it works so
well
it's mainly because of the frequency
which adds up to a lot of weekly volume
next obviously lowers my sag right you
guys know this was coming
my style and the number one muscle
killer if you don't know what my stand
is if you've been living under a rock
watch my video on it but pretty much you
understand it returns to baseline
really fast after training right so when
you train you lower myostatin which
allows your muscles to grow
it allows your satellite cells to
proliferate and multiply
but it goes back up within 24 hours
with katsu or pum training because
you're training so frequently and you
can train multiple times a day
you're able to keep my stand at low
levels which is also how steroids work
people don't know this steroids lower
myostatin that's that's what lowers my
state
so these people are constantly have low
levels of myostatin
next extremely time efficient right
takes less than five minutes per muscle
you know or exercise to do pump training
or blood blood flow restriction or
whatever even drop sets and i made a
video about the drop set study right all
the drops of studies have shown that
you're putting on the same amount of
muscle
as someone who's lifting heavy but
you're doing that in seventy percent
less time
seventy percent that means a one hour
workout is reduced to 17 minutes guys
that's insane
extremely time efficient for people who
have lives and jobs and things like that
and like i said it allows you to come
back to the gym in the evening and work
out again
right so you're getting the same growth
with 70 percent less time
and it's also for more cardio because
again you're getting so much work done
in a short amount of time
next it increases fast phosphorus muscle
activation like i mentioned earlier you
gotta recruit those five switch fibers
you know and you know you guys know the
famous comparison between marathon
runners and
sprinters what is the difference why is
it that marathon runners look like [ __ ]
and sprinters all drive right it's all
about the muscle fibers strength is
obviously using fast switch
high threshold motor units marathon
runners are not right
and when you're doing blood flow
restriction training you're increasing
faster's activation even though the
weight is not heavy remember these guys
are using extremely light weights now i
don't recommend you use waste that light
people have this misconception that when
i say light weights i'm referring to
[ __ ] 100 rep sets no when i said
light i mean 15 to 20 reps maybe
maybe 20 to 30 but no more than that
right
you can go higher but it's not time
efficient
so high threshold motor units are the
most capable of growth
and you get to recruit them with katsu
which is the reason why again it gives
you the same gains as someone lifting
heavy
it's all about the fiber recruitment
next it maximizes satellite cell
activity
up to three times more so believe it or
not and i've been talking about this for
so long people think
that you have to have muscle damage to
activate satellite cells to have infuse
and cause hyperplasia
[ __ ] there are so many [ __ ]
studies on this guys
so many showing you that no you do not
need
to excessively damage your muscle to
have cellulite activation
you can do that with hormones you know
rgf1 mechanical growth factor all of
which are released with
high rep training inflammation is going
to cause that uh
adrenaline obviously you get a lot of
adrenaline when you're doing
drop sets and you know blood flow
restriction lactic acid of course
reactive oxygen pretty much all the
metabolic stress factors
increase that lifestyle activation even
with minimal muscle damage
just remember katsu is the only training
method that has the lowest amount of
muscle damage out of every single
training technique out there next
walking
this is amazing katsu is the only
training system where people are
actually putting on muscle obviously not
a ton
but actually putting putting on muscle
from just walking right and you can look
that up guys they're literally putting
[ __ ] um the bands around the thighs
and walking for about 20 minutes
and you see muscle growth which does not
happen under normal conditions
next bad rest again katsu has been
tested on patients
you know and that's why it's such a
popular technique because it works
even on old people and like i said guys
if you want to find something that works
don't look for what works on untrained
people or
people with good you know look for what
works on old people because all people
are the hardest people to put muscle on
so if something works on trained men or
old people
it's gonna work on the average person
because those [ __ ] are almost
impossible
um to see how pressure feeling yet katsu
shows extreme
increases in muscle growth in
populations that we previously thought
could not build muscle you know
with half sometimes eighty percent less
weight and again they've done
experiments where with people that have
um cast on their legs due to surgery or
their bedridden coma whatever
where when you apply catsu they actually
lose
less muscle if you're not aware when
your leg is immobilized you actually
lose a ton of muscle because it's
obviously not moving it's almost like
astronauts in space they come back and
you know they look like smeago they lost
all their muscle gains
because there's no gravity you know
there's no tension on the muscles
but for some reason even if you're lag
even if you land in bed
and you apply blood flow restriction the
muscle loses
less myofibers next pump training
increases rj41 you guys knew that was
coming
again igf-1 has a very very short
half-life
so the more frequent the workouts the
better the increases in that critical
peptide
against master regulator of satellite
cells critical for hyperplasia
critical for strength gains protein
sentences mtor protein breakdown
obviously it lowers myostatin
and it also increases the activity of
the androgen receptor
not to mention glycogen and bone acid
and things like that next it maximizes
growth hormone right again growth
hormone is needed for igf-1 so you can
pretty much copy and paste all the
effects of igf-1
and you're going to see that with growth
hormone and believe it or not you know
there's a lot of rumors that growth
hormone is not anabolic that is wrong
growth hormone is extremely anabolic
and there's also a lot of research
backing that up where you know growth
hormone and rjf1 combined
actually have a double effect as opposed
to one or the other
so again it's gonna help you with your
joints your recovery bone density fat
loss
obviously increasing testosterone and
things like that next
katsu blood flow restriction increases
lactate you know which is common sense
guys remember
the proof of fat switch activation is
lactic acid right
without burning with too many details
when your fat switch muscles contract
and fatigue
they release lactic acid so if you're
getting a burn that's the number one
indicator that you're recruiting your
fast response because a lot of people
like well me how do i know i'm
recruiting my fascist fibers well are
you getting a burn are you getting that
crazy lactic
acid buildup that's the sign that you're
using them because guess what slow
twitch muscles
release carbon dioxide and water fast
switch muscles release
lactate when they contract right so
going for that pump going for that burn
that's one of the number one indicators
that you're recruiting the muscles that
are going to have the biggest response
to training right and of course lactate
has different effects you know lowers my
stat and cell swelling satellite cells
you know
the typical stuff also don't forget
lactic acid
increases the conversion of igf-1 to
igf-1 deaths right which is obviously
there
a much more powerful version of igf-1
next
increases them so you guys know by now
if you've been watching my videos m tau
is the
king of protein synthesis you could have
dna transcription all you want you could
have all the testosterone that you want
but if you don't have mtar to obviously
kick start the you know ribosome and
translation process you're not going to
put on muscle
and obviously bf4 increases mtor it
increases glycogen capacity right so
you're able to actually store more carbs
within your muscles gives you a fuller
look
right um also allows you to eat more
carbs obviously
allows you to train harder makes you
stronger pretty much the performance
increases
next increases the insulin sensitivity
right so it mobilizes group four for you
guys who remember the car backloading
videos
um very important for you know insulin
sensitivity and also the frequent
training obviously helps with that
because again if you're training
frequently
that allows you to process carbs better
next let's call the circles you're in
the gym
a lot less longer right so less cortisol
means
better recovery better hormonal profile
remember guys
cortisol increases my status so you want
that [ __ ] down right you don't want it
to add zero obviously
but you don't want it to be too elevated
if you're in a gym for two hours
non-stop you're gonna get a cortisol
response you know and it's obviously
gonna interfere with protein synthesis
and things like that
next it increases self-swelling and i
already made a video about that the more
hydrated the cell is
the bigger the anabolic signals lower
protein breakdown
extremely extremely low risk of injuries
guys you're not going to snap your [ __ ]
up lifting 50 of your one rare max or in
some cases even 30 to 40
right but you will when you constantly
constantly
you know pushing extremely heavy weights
you know which i'm not against remember
hsb training has a lot of heavy lifting
into that you know that's how you're
going to get that bone density
but doing that every single day is
eventually going to lead to some
injuries how do you guys think i snapped
my [ __ ] up you know my lower back from
rock pools and
my shoulders my knees it was just from
doing constant heavy lifting every
single day
when i really didn't have to do that so
extremely low risk of injury
longevity is key i know when we're young
we don't care about the future that's
what i was but trust me
those injuries are going to nag you for
the rest of your life partial range of
motion and that study came out a while
ago if you're not familiar with it
pretty much to show that
they took two groups and these are
trained men and a group doing partial
range of motion for it was triceps it
was a scar brushes i believe
had 70 percent more gains and sure
enough that they looked at the
correlations to find out what was the
reason even though the volume was equal
the weight was equal
it was mainly because of the pump you
know the cell swelling the metabolic
stress
you know the hypoxic environment so
again you guys remember the bros were
right you know everyone used to say oh
you know you got to do full range of
motion and i think i made a video a big
rant about that years ago
uh where i explained that you don't need
full range of motion as long as you
split it up into different exercises
right because it's almost impossible to
do full range of motion for any muscle
period right because of strength curves
and things like that so
it's better if you split it up you know
you know different angles same thing
with biceps triceps
legs you name it right so full range of
motion is overrated
now if you obviously a strength athlete
and that's what you're worried about
then
you know absolutely but for hypertrophy
you don't need full range of motion
on every exercise especially if you're
splitting them up and doing multiple
exercises
hsp you're doing the full range of
motion of every muscle anyway because
you're training it in a stretched
position
in the contracted position and obviously
in the entire range of motion
and again you know godzilla increases
vgf and nitric oxide production which is
going to help you with vascularity it's
going to help you get better pumps in
the future
um better blood circulation better
recovery pretty much
all the nutrients that are in your blood
are going to be delivered to the target
issues a lot better so it is a cheat
code for volume and frequency guys
pump training is a cheat code because
you're able to accumulate volume
accumulate frequency less injuries less
muscle damage which is why
the fastest growth on record is always
with katsu
it's a cheat code guys it allows you to
bypass
all the negative effects of constantly
lifting heavy
while reaping the very same benefits and
in many cases even more
while the few people promote it simple
number one is ego right
because people hate the fact that for
years they were preaching you got to get
stronger to get bigger
you got to put you got to bring your
[ __ ] bench from 200 to [ __ ] 800
to build muscle and now all the studies
are showing that they were clearly wrong
right especially the guys who were
bashing me years ago saying oh megan
doesn't know what he's talking about
you know higher up training is not going
to work for 90s they're not going to
talk about bfr because
it literally shows that they were wrong
right so ego is the number one reason
why blood flow restriction is not that
popular in the fitness community even
though it is
so effective and recognized all around
the world
so i tell you guys beware of experts
because expert bias is going to stop
them
from giving you guys the truth because
they value their reputation
more than the truth the second thing is
obviously it's not good for business
gyms hate it because if you know that
you can build muscle without heavy
weights
that's less gym membership you know
that's just common sense so how do you
black out too
number one you could use it on your
upper arm on your upper leg
don't put it anywhere else don't do no
dumb [ __ ] don't put on your knees don't
put on your neck right
again there goes the creator here he's
showing how to apply it you don't have
to use those exact same bands but you
get the idea
also keep in mind it applies to your
chest and your back as well right
studies have shown that if you're
benching with katsu
even though the bands are on your arms
your chest actually grows more than the
control group
right and it's due to different you know
different factors not only you have the
um the circulation of the anabolic
factors but you also have a higher
recruitment of your chest since your
triceps fatigue a lot faster without too
the tightness keep it on the 70 scale so
if 10 is the tightest
you want to be around seven i bump it up
to eight funny story me and one of my
class was talking about this uh
i believe it was yeah it was this
weekend and it was hilarious you know
they say john you said me again when you
make that video
make sure you let him know you know not
to overdo it you know i said hey it's
coming because there's always gonna be
that [ __ ] who's gonna be like hey you
know
according to them you know no pain no
gain they're gonna put a [ __ ] 20 out
of 10 tightness and drop that you know
so we definitely don't want that i was
laughing so hard because it's true you
know someone's going to say
no pain no gain i got to progressively
overload the tightness you know go to 20
out of 10 and [ __ ] snap this [ __ ] up
so follow the rules 7 out of 10 it's
extremely safe remember this this has
been researched on
old dying [ __ ] so they're not
going to apply something
that's going to kill you on all people
right and they're going to get sued out
of the ass so it's extremely safe as
long as you follow the rules
uh set recommendation again same thing
as nuclear solar right five sets
uh 15 or 30 reps people are always
asking me should i go to failure or not
the answer is always the same guys you
want to go as close or fairly as
possible without
really killing yourself right so leave
about one or two reps in the tank
um and again which is why i'm so
surprised that people think that you
have to use
[ __ ] waist on uh nucleus overload you
know when i say lightweight i'm always
referring to 15 or higher heavy weight
is anything less than
six to eight reps right moderate weight
is about 12 to 15
light weights for me is 15 or 30 15 or
20 in that ballpark
right um as far as rest between sets
again follow a drop set
raspberries protocol you want to keep
raspberry short remember the goal is to
get a pump so just focus on the pump
uh you could do it up to twice a day
three to six times a day pretty much
just like nucleus overload guys
um you can use it for hsp training for
the p part right for the pump exercises
you could also use it for the stretch
exercises
i don't recommend you use that for the h
exercises because the age part of hsp is
mainly strength training
right which is again i keep showing you
i'm not against strength training you
know it has this place
you just have to know how to program it
right uh and obviously you could use
that for nucleus overload as well
use that as a way to intensify your
workouts um and again
it's gonna give you the biggest pumps of
your [ __ ] life guys i
i'm not kidding anyone who's done it
will tell you the pumps are insane
a lot of you [ __ ] have no clue how
much of a pump
their body is able to produce until you
do blood flow restriction it's insane
your arms feel like they're about to
explode
so try it out guys and again you know
you don't have to do blood flow
restriction or do bump training you know
it just speeds up the process
you could do drop sets you could do

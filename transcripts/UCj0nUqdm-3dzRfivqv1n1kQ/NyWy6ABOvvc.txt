hey guys what's going on megan here what
happens when you train
with very very low testosterone i'm
talking
hypogonadal testosterone levels what
happens
uh so i was looking for ideas for
today's testosterone thursday
and i dug up this whole study you know i
have archives
of hundreds and hundreds of studies and
sometimes i just look to them and i'm
like hey you know
let's make a video about this now this
one was interesting because
it answers a lot of questions you know
what happens when you train with low
testosterone does it make
does it make a huge difference does it
matter you know
um as long as you uh as long as you're
progressively overloading and
and choosing the right exercises does it
matter if you train with very low
uh testosterone that was or is this
something you should fix right away well
let's find out this study is actually
hilarious because you see when i get to
the details like
i don't know why the people volunteered
for this study because i i never would
all right back to the video so this is
what they did right you had two groups
of people right you have group one
young men and you had group two right so
two groups of young men
they are pretty much untrained so you
could expect obviously to see a
large increase in muscle mass they're
about 24 years old right like i said
mid-20s and they were put
on the eight-week training program right
and this is the hilarious part group one
was obviously the control group right so
they were just training
training for eight weeks uh standard
protocol three times a week the basic
movements you know for everybody about
chest back legs
um three to four sets six to ten basic
standard workout protocol and group two
was obviously training but here's the
difference they were injected with
acetylene
and for those who are not familiar with
how it works pretty much it shuts down
testosterone production
completely right it shuts down uh your
natural testosterone production
in case you need a refresher
testosterone production starts in the
brain
right your hypothalamus sends a signal
to your pituitary gland
so you have gonadotropin releasing
hormone comes out of the hypothalamus
she goes to the pituitary gland
causes it to release luteinize the
hormone which obviously goes to your
balls
and converts cholesterol to testosterone
right again as always i'm skipping a
bunch of steps but
let's keep the video short so back to
the study yes so they inject these guys
because they're relevant and that's what
i'm laughing is because
i don't know who the hell will volunteer
for that i would never volunteer to have
my testosterone production shut down
and look what happened first obviously
that testosterone levels were shut down
as you can see
the normal testosterone group there you
know they stayed at about 600
right about 640 nanograms per deciliter
which is within the normal range you
know the normal ranges between 300 to
1000
so these guys within the normal range
and the gazillion group
dropped and this is the funniest spot
dropped to 57 right so the testosterone
levels
dropped from over 600 it was initially
650 for them
and dropped all the way to 50 which is
pretty much within the range of you know
what a woman has you know women have
been anywhere between 10 and 60.
so their t levels were crushed
right crushed and again that was the
goal of the study right to see what
happens when you train with super
super low testosterone levels now let's
look at the results
the normal group put in put on about 10
percent right as far as strength gains
right so the strength increase about 10
you know which is pretty good pretty
decent but
look at this guys because everyone group
only had about
two percent 2.6 percent increase in
strength which is
laughable keep in mind these guys follow
relatively the same training protocol
everything but look at the increase in
strength which is to show you how
important your hormonal health is you
know you just can't you just can't
compromise it right same protocol
same progressive overload same
everything right but look at the
increase in strength from the group that
pretty much had a testosterone
production shutdown this is laughable
they put on about
five times less strength than the normal
group
next let's look at lean mass right so
that lag lean mass
uh not surprisingly they put on some
mass but as you can tell there's a clear
difference
right between the amount of mass put on
by the normal group that had normal
testosterone levels
and the guys that were shut down clear
difference you have about three point
six percent here
compared to about five and a half
percent here right so
not only that put on less strength but
obviously put on less muscle mass right
and of course you know they did put some
muscle you're going to put on some
muscle right because
the stats on is not the only agent uh
when it comes to building muscle you
still have myostatin and you have
phylostat and a bunch of other agents
that are responsible for
four months ago but as you can clearly
see uh they're putting the same work
and got less gains and here's the
hilarious part you know
uh the group that had normal
testosterone levels lost fat
right which you this this is what
usually happens when you're new to the
gym and you know
you know you follow a good protocol most
of the time you're going to go through a
recombred you're going to put on some
some lean muscle
um and you might even lose fat so the
normal group lost about three and a half
percent
of fat but check out the gaceroline
group these guys actually put on
fat they put on about nine percent of
fat mass
same protocol same training same eating
right
but these guys lost fat and obviously
get you know build muscle and strength
whatever it was these guys
not only put on less strength less
muscle but they
gain fat now which is what i've been
telling you guys for years the status
one is not just for
muscle building it's a very very potent
hormone
for fat loss and i explained in several
videos you know it
uh it increases your metabolic rate it
increases your fat oxidation it
increases the amount of uh
better receptors in your fat cells on
and so forth right and as you can see
here i mean this is ridiculous
nine percent increase in fat mass while
following the same protocol
and same diet and this is why i said
earlier in the video that i would never
volunteer for study like this like
i don't care how much you pay me never
volunteer now
again this is an ethical study obviously
the guys knew what they were signing
signing up for
um and of course the testosterone levels
went back to normal
but it took about six months it took
about six months after the the study was
over
for the t levels to go back to normal uh
but still you know just
just to show you how important having
optimal
uh hormone levels is for for muscle
building and body composition in general
you know that's why i tell you guys time
and time again you could train all you
want
you could follow all the principles of
training all the principles of dieting
calories and calories out progressively
you could do all of that you could do
all of that but if your hormones are not
optimized
you're wasting your time so optimize
your hormones guys even in the healthy
range even in the healthy range it
matters
watch my video on how to optimize your
testosterone levels naturally right you
don't have to hop on trt especially if
you're young you know like i have a lot
of young guys trying to hop on tlt i'm
like what are you doing you know
unless you're like 60 years old or you
have a medical condition have no
business happening
but again that's just my opinion i'm not
a doctor i'm not allowed to make these
recommendations
that's just my opinion if you want to
hear it if you're young uh if you're
healthy
i'm always going to recommend that you
do it the right way
that you do it a natural way because
once you hop on tlt there's no going
back
anyway let me know what you guys think
of the study you know is this something
that you guys would
volunteer for if you have sub-optimal
testosterone levels and i mean really
sub-optimal
um and you're not seeing gains in the
gym or you know you're struggling to put
on mass
hey you know get checked and this is not
me pushing out my sponsor i've been
making these videos on testosterone for
years in fact that's how my sponsor
found me so make sure you optimize your
levels
um especially if you're a male and best
of luck in your muscle building journey

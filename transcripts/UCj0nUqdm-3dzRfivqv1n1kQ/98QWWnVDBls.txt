hey guys what's going on megan here long
time no talk to you [ __ ]
how to take the usual break and i'm
right back at it so i figured i was like
you know what what video should i make
for
um uh for pretty much for today's video
and i notice well it's tuesday so
top tier tuesday it is and as far as the
topic goes one of my subscribers that
asked me uh
to make a video on protein sources i
figured you know what let's combine that
with today's episode of tap day tuesday
so top 10 protein sources for
maximum muscle growth or by the way if
you if you wonder where i've been
same thing you know just working on
projects the stock market was on fire so
usually i focus on that because again
that's my main source of income
youtube is just for fun right youtube is
just my passion so
i'm always gonna put that on the on the
back burner whenever the market heats up
uh but anyway so let's get straight to
it all right so top 10 protein sources
for maximum muscle growth
we still have the five categories if you
guys remember number one is at the top
i'm about to not
okay is in the middle and pure garbage
is at the bottom
all right so let's see and the criteria
that i'm using is
i'm only using two criteria right number
one it has to maximize protein synthesis
right so it has to have a very high
leucine content
that's really what's going to help
maximize um you know m toe activation
and things like that
and actually number two it has to be you
know nutrient dense right so a lot of
vitamins and minerals
um you know on and so forth so let's
pick them at random here we have pork
believe it or not pork is very very
underrated right when it comes to
building muscle we always hear about
chicken we always hear about beef
but we rarely hear about pork right it's
very underrated
i'm gonna put that in the okay category
right it has a very high leucine content
right
and obviously has its own shade of
vitamins you know mainly b vitamins and
stuff like that
so i'm gonna put in okay uh milk believe
it or not
even though milk is one of my most
recommended uh
foods for bulking uh this video is about
just protein right this video is mainly
protein so
uh milk by itself is not very high in
protein even though that's where whey
protein is derived from
right so actually you know what i'm
gonna put
pork at [ __ ] amazing i'm gonna put
milk out okay
all right so much gonna be out okay uh
in fact [ __ ] that [ __ ] that [ __ ] that
milk is gonna be a bad
and this is gonna be okay and i'm gonna
explain why right because
the amount of milk you have to drink
just to get like 20 grams of protein
you know it just doesn't make sense
right in fact if you're drinking whole
milk you're going to get a lot more
fat than protein if you're drinking skim
milk
you're just going to get a ton of carbs
right so i'm going to put milk at bad
as far as you know protein goes just
pure protein
now if this video was just about foods
just to gain weight in general
then you already know milk would be
number one right
um and i already made a video about that
so just look it up if you uh if you have
questions
uh next shrimp shrimp is gonna be out
okay right has a very good uh
has a decent uh leucine content it's not
top tier
and obviously it has its own share of
nutrients but
but it's definitely not top tier right
next we have
beans right now i'm actually going to
put beans at
bad and i'm going to tell you guys why
now number one for protein sentences
which is the main reason why it's not
higher is you have to eat a ton
a ton of beans just to get the same
amount of protein sentences
that you would get from eating chicken
or steak or whatever right
mainly because you're trying to get all
different amino acids uh
so as far as protein synthesis goes
beans is not as high you know as most
people think now
the reason why it's not down here is
because beans are
very very very high nutrients right very
in fact
if this video was uh uh skewed towards
uh nutrients more beans would be at the
top right you cannot [ __ ] with beans
when it comes to nutrients so many
vitamins and minerals
but for the sake of just you know
packing on size now if you're vegan of
course you know this is going to be at
the top right
uh but for someone who just eats
everything um
beans will not be at the top if i'm just
trying to maximize muscle growth right
i'm trying to maximize protein sentences
uh next eggs eggs is definitely
gonna be in [ __ ] amazing category
right um now
of course you're not gonna get a maximum
protein sentence as a response after
eating eggs simply because the digestion
so slowly
but the bioavailability is the highest
uh very high availability and you're
obviously going to have a lot of you
know a lot of nutrients right
vitamins and minerals so you just can't
[ __ ] with eggs you know
not to mention eggs are very [ __ ]
affordable i know that's not one of the
criteria for this video
but you know just throw that out there
so eggs [ __ ] amazing
um usually obviously there's a reason
why it's the you know one of the top
breakfast foods
and and like i said yes it that just
very slowly but
you know that kind of comes in handy
because you're always going to have
amino acids
um in your blood throughout the day uh
next we have cottage cheese and
now here actually because i wanted to
keep this video short only 10 foods
uh this is cottage cheese and it's also
uh greek yogurt right so pretty much
things that are high in caffeine
so i'm gonna put that out okay right
uh mainly because yes you're getting a
lot of protein you're not getting a lot
of uh
um you're not gonna get a big spike in
protein sentences but
similar to eggs you're gonna have slow
digesting protein throughout the day or
if you eat it at night throughout the
night
so it's not gonna maximize your muscle
growth response
short term but you know it's gonna make
sure that you always have amino acids
available
for when your body needs especially if
you're going a long period of time
without eating
uh next whey protein obviously whey
protein is that [ __ ] amazing when it
comes to protein synthesis
right highest leucine content by far um
obviously you guys know the right for
milk and it's pretty much just
it would have been higher if it was not
that shitty when it came to
micronutrients right
that's the only downside of whey protein
right you're not getting a lot of
micronutrients
uh but as far as maximizing the muscle
the protein sentences response
definitely up there [ __ ] amazing uh
next chicken breast even though it's
[ __ ] you know again it's chicken
breasts maybe it could also be chicken
twice whatever
i'm gonna put in a [ __ ] amazing um
yeah i know a lot of people say chicken
is overrated whatever but there's a
reason
why you know it survived the test of
time right so obviously you're getting a
lot of leucine right has a lot of
leucine
it's definitely in the top three when it
comes to losing content
um the taste depends on how you cook it
right it doesn't taste like ass
the vitamins and minerals again it's not
[ __ ] top tier
uh but it's enough to get you by
especially if you're eating it with
something else you know spinach and
things like that
so [ __ ] amazing um and again i know
i know we're not mentioning uh cost but
it's very [ __ ] affordable
uh next you have salmon oh my god i'm
about to not right so
fish specifically salmon right because
obviously not all fish are created equal
right not not all fish matter hashtag
um salmon is
number one and keep in mind like yes i'm
a sushi fanatic but i actually don't
like
fish that much i'm not a big fish fan
i'm not a big salmon fan
i'm just keeping this video objective
fish
is i mean salmon is super super high
on the list when it comes to uh you know
if you know if you're trying to put a
muscle you know
it's gonna optimize your protein
sentences right
not as high as whey protein but a lot of
things compared with protein
but when it comes to nutrients oh my
goodness so
so nutrient dense you know um and not to
mention that you also have a lot of
vitamin d you know which is obviously a
hormone
and percent of [ __ ] out there are
deficient in vitamin d so
it does not hurt uh you know to load up
fish
to load up on salmon so
salmon by far right if you have to you
know
go grocery shopping you have to make a
meal plan um
and you know you're trying to figure out
hey what protein should i prioritize
salmon of course you're gonna build
muscle you know regardless of what
protein you eat
long term but i'm talking about just
maximizing
uh the protein synthesis response to
getting the most out of your work as the
most out of your diet
salmon by four you're getting your
omega-3s you're getting your vitamin d
you're getting you lose
everything right and obviously the
second one i'm about
which is also now i'm about to not is
beef beef is up there and it's again
it's up there but it's second to salmon
and the main reason is obviously you
know beef
beef is very high in leucine uh you're
gonna have a lot of zinc
you have creatine which is obviously not
a huge amount but that you know
definitely has a
uh large amount of creatine relative to
the other foods
you're getting your b vitamins i mean
and you're getting your cholesterol you
know
unless you're taking a very very very
lean lean cut you know people forget
cholesterol
is very important when it comes to
bodybuilding and putting on muscle
it's not just for the synthesis of
testosterone but it also has anabolic
properties i'm going to make a video in
the future about cholesterol
but that's it guys trying to keep this
video short
uh salmon and beef is at the top right
uh now of course it's it's no
coincidence that those two are also very
expensive so if you're looking for
something that's more budget friendly
you might want to go down to the [ __ ]
amazing category
chicken whey protein and eggs um that's
the only downside of salmon and beef
right
way too [ __ ] expensive but [ __ ] it um
but of course you have uh
you know pork shrimp and uh you know
casein
pretty much you know greek yogurt uh
cottage cheese
out okay and for bad you know you have
milk and beans remember you know i'm
putting in my bad
relative to the other protein sources
that does not mean that they're bad
uh by themselves okay so this is just
relative to the other sources when it
comes to protein
by the way guys hope this video helps
comment below
let me know what you want next tuesday's
top 10 tuesday to be on all right

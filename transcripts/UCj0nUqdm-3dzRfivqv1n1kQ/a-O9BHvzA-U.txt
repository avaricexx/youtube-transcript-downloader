hey guys what's going on megan here so
you guys requested this one
uh top marvel mcu characters actually
actors physiques
right i kept it at 20 because there's
like over 100 of them there's no way in
hell i was going to everybody
so i tried to stick to the guys that we
actually saw or got an idea what they
look like
on screen uh with one exception which
you guys are gonna see in a minute
um and i kept it at 20 right the the
ones that are easily recognizable
i was gonna pick those random ass
characters to waste time
and of course since this is top tier
tuesday we ranking them based on
who has the most impressive jacked
physique right
the physique that we want to be like as
bodybuilders
and once again a disclaimer this
disclaimer kills me every time but
remember guys
the categories were not designed to rank
people right they were designed to rank
when i started this series months ago
they were designed to rank foods and
exercises and stuff like that right
so i'm about to not [ __ ] amazing all
that stuff that was for foods
and exercises and workouts it was not
for dudes
but i don't feel like changing it so
keep that in mind
because i know things are about to sound
super suspect in a few minutes
when i start putting guys in the ammo
box in that category
but anyway let's get started all right
so um baku
we're gonna put um man
the thing is he was supposed to be a
jack character but he just carried so
much body fat
so [ __ ] this is actually a tough one the
first one is actually
super tough so i'm gonna put that let's
go through the restaurant i'm not gonna
put that pure garbage because they're
obviously worth physiques
um hint i'm not gonna put it at
so nice between bad and okay we know
it's definitely not in i'm about to not
category right
it's definitely not [ __ ] amazing so
it's between okay and bad i want to put
it at okay right
simply because despite the high body fat
you know there's some gains under there
next uh don trudeau so i'm gonna put him
at i want to put him at bad right he
wasn't really you know he wasn't again
you understand a lot of these characters
were not supposed to be jack so
um i'm gonna put in my back uh next you
guys already know
but just you guys know i used to be a
big wrestling fan huge wwe fan
uh back when it was actually [ __ ]
worth watching and batista was one of
the guys that came in right before my
exit
but anyway long story short i'm about to
not category drax
had those epic traps um just
bodybuilder type physique obviously it
could be bad if it was on stage but you
know what [ __ ] i mean
next ham though to be honest guys we
didn't really get to see these games
yeah i'm pretty sure
you know keep in mind we're not ranking
them based on
what they look like in real life right
we talking about on-screen
physiques so he was covered most of the
time so
i'm going to put him at
[ __ ] man this is tough because i'm
pretty sure he was he was
low-key jacked underneath but we got to
go bishop based on what we have so i'm
just gonna put that bad right cause we
didn't really get to see anything
um next
not only he didn't do [ __ ] throughout
the whole mcu
but you guys already know too many
donuts so
pure garbage next uh tony stark i'm
actually um
i actually picked this physique because
that's the only time when he was
relatively you know muscular uh when he
was stuck in that cave
so robert downey jr i'm gonna put you at
[ __ ] man this is tough i want to put it
out okay in front of me
right because i would much rather have
this physique than this one
um let's see uh
[ __ ] i want to put that one higher but
now next you guys already know
thor my favorite marvel character of all
time since i was a little [ __ ]
it was always jugging out thor all the
buff characters you guys already know me
you guys already know the story
so i'm gonna put him in [ __ ] i'm gonna
put him i'm about to not category
but uh yeah right here behind batista
[ __ ] that sounds so suspect but anyway
um
next captain [ __ ] america
when he came out with his chat super
pumped
like he was in the hyperbolic time
chamber doing
hell of push-ups helen nucleus overload
let's see
i'm gonna put that [ __ ] amazing right
[ __ ] amazing physique um
it's not going hard because it was all
traps right i mean sorry it was all
chests right no traps
it was all just chests and arms um
so next
we're gonna put mark at pure garbage
obviously uh
obviously if the hulk was on here you
guys already know the hulk was gonna go
i'm about to not
tom holland um again i know you guys
want it higher but you guys know me man
i don't like those skinny
lean red physiques i know everybody uh
likes those types of physiques but since
i was a kid it was i was
always fascinated by the mask monster so
i'm putting him out okay i'm just gonna
put him higher than uh
uh i'm gonna put him hard and and get
the [ __ ] here
i'm gonna put him higher than uh robert
so i'm gonna put it out okay i know a
lot of you guys probably have it at
[ __ ] amazing but nah guys i really
hate that
skinny ass sucked in lean physique it
looks
it looks uh it looks big on pictures but
in real life when you're that lame
you look small as [ __ ] next
star-lord who [ __ ] up the whole
[ __ ] movie for everybody
um if it wasn't for him you guys already
know they knows what i've gotten
the rest of the finnish stones but
anyway so hmm
the guardians of the galaxy physique i'm
gonna put that [ __ ] man to be honest you
actually look pretty decent in that
in that shot so i'm gonna put it in
[ __ ] amazing right behind
uh evans next come on man i'm putting
this up
[ __ ] i want to put this that back i'm
putting this at bad man hawkeye was
not only he was the most [ __ ] useless
character i'm sorry
but um uh physique was same thing right
again we didn't really get to see it
a lot but i wouldn't put it that bad
next believe it or not loki
i had no idea he was that raped until
the new series came out obviously uh on
decent plus
and in that scene that's when i realized
holy [ __ ] man he's [ __ ] ripped
so obviously i'm gonna put this uh to be
honest
i'm going to put this in front of tom
holland all right in the okay category
i'm going to put this right here
man what is it there you go all right i
want to put in [ __ ] amazing because
i'm not allowed he looks [ __ ]
ripped in this shot here but um
if he put his shirt on he would not look
like he lifts right and that's what i
hate about those super lean physiques
right they only look good with good
lighting
and you know with a pump or whatever
moment you put a shirt on they look like
smigo
all right next i'm definitely putting
this in [ __ ] amazing you guys already
know
killmonger brought a crazy physique i'm
gonna put that
[ __ ] man i'm gonna put that right here
in between [ __ ] i'm actually gonna put
that in front of
uh captain america right here because he
was [ __ ] jacked
super jacked in that role uh next
rest in peace uh t'challa this one
um he wasn't really jack guys right so
he's going into okay category
uh so yeah he's going in okay category
right he wasn't really jack he was lean
right um definitely above these guys but
he wasn't [ __ ] amazing uh type [ __ ]
next ant-man surprisingly
i'm also gonna put him in okay you know
again back to that lean physique but
you know no mass so i'm going to put on
somewhere
we'll say here all right yeah we'll say
here
next doctor strange man get your punk
ass over here
it's definitely going in bad i don't
care where he goes you know
bad um once again let's be fair he
wasn't meant to be a buff character
next winter soldier we definitely got to
put
bucky at [ __ ] this is tough this is
tough i want to put him in [ __ ]
amazing to be honest
um [ __ ] he's somewhere between
okay and [ __ ] amazing so i'm just
gonna put him here at the end right
um [ __ ] amazing category but really
really really close to being
okay uh next you have
sam we're gonna put if i can add uh
only thing you got here is just biceps
you know what i mean just biceps
i'm gonna put them out okay all right
i'm gonna put them out okay um somewhere
we'll say right here and last but not

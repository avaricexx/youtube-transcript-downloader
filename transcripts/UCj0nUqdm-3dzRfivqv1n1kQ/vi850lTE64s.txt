all right guys so got back from grocery
shopping that's the video farming shop
just a quick trip quick run actually
came out to only 30 dollars by the way
shout out to beat sales for the shirt
actually you know
hugs the sleeves
uh
so i got some tuna let me get the tuna
out of the way first got some tuna for
my
my my salad
i like making salads with corn mixed
veggies mayo and boiled eggs so i need a
lot of tuna for that's the only to be
honest the only time i could actually
eat tuna is when this with corn and uh
in the chicken salad or some [ __ ] other
than that i just hate the consistency of
tuna it's so dry i'm a consistency guy
all right um
got me some macarella try it out got
this from my uncle it's actually pretty
good
um smells like saltines a bit it's
actually pretty good and you get 12
grams of protein per serving and it
comes with five servings so it's about
you know you know 50 something uh listen
60 grams of protein for just this right
there uh usually i stir fry it
and i uh mix it with onions and stuff
like that really good
got me cucumber for my dildo it's
[ __ ] chill it's for my sushi
um
some onions once again thinking about
bodybuilding the key to keeping your
nutritional point of vibrating to find
ways to make the same boring foods taste
good right so i get onions garlic
whatever seasoning i could use to make
my food taste better because guys to be
honest i really hate first of all i got
a bad appetite that's bad enough then i
hate eating the same [ __ ] all the time
except sushi so you gotta find ways to
make your chicken leg orders or your
ground beef taste different so you don't
get bored right um i got some heavy
whipped cream for my chicken alfredo
right some days i'm going to stir fry my
chicken with onions some days i'm going
to make a chicken alfredo stuff
i said just a quick one not special and
i say i got me some cabbage once again i
can eat this with chicken if i eat
chicken with
uh the chicken alfredo today the next
day could be stir-fry with cabbage just
find ways to switch stuff up if you
still want me to make recipe videos let
me know how'd you get i just get lazy
every now and then
um and last but not least i got me some
tangerines just for my citrus right you
got to have your food died you got to
get your citrus uh another thing that
citrus does a lot of people don't know
about this is it helps your body helps
your liver detoxify estrogen which is
great guys you don't want that estrogen
circulating over your [ __ ] blood
especially when you fat like me so
that means a lot of oranges mandarines i
should say because oranges were too
expensive
it's pretty much the same thing
plus
alkalinize your body i cannot pronounce
that word for [ __ ]
and my lemon is obviously here
you can't go wrong with fruits guys
nature
has everything you need and that's it
guys uh what else i got
yeah
i got my chicken leg quarters
once again me and my uncle doing big
research because we really
we really think there's something wrong
with chicken legos guys it has to be
that one [ __ ] chicken or it has to
be the [ __ ] the one chains that are
missing chromosomes or whatever because
this is 10 pounds for six six dollars
and chance which is
unbelievable guys if you study economics
there's no way they're making a profit
unless it's literally like i said a
chromosome missing ass chicken it has to
be guys because
this is 10 pounds for six dollars and if
you buy chicken drums separately you get
like 10 no like eight for like probably
eight or nine bucks guys so this makes
no sense but hey guys we have no choice
live in america y'all eat what you're
giving if you live in those poor
countries then you you in the best
atmosphere to build muscle because your
food doesn't have hormones in it doesn't
have too many pesticides it takes longer
to to you know to produce it but hey at
least you're getting healthy [ __ ] so i
got this
and um
and plus how's it been me my parents
always said the husband's been in this
[ __ ] for over a year and so forth so far
he doesn't have any any any uh visible
defects
so
i guess it's good
i got me some eggs
once again i make eggs in the morning
every morning that's my social leucine
my cheap social leucine and i also make
bold x eat with my chicken salad so
that's it guys what i got
from the
grocery store
i just gotta clean up the fridge a
little bit and make room for that all
right so if you want the cooking videos
let me know if not then i don't feel
like the videos not [ __ ] you i'm out
all right guys just woke up did my
little jump rope jogging all that [ __ ]
and i'm about to get my first cold
shower a try that's not my first thing
my second one the first one didn't
really count because i cheated that [ __ ]
was just too much man it was too painful
guys i'm african man we're used to the
heat but uh so this is our official
first one

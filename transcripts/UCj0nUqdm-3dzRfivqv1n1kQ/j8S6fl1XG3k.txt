you know all right so guys when you're
done putting your rice on there make
sure you always
leave some room for you later on um
close up the the
roll so we have that done make sure you
have your water on the side cuz the rice
is pretty sticky as you can tell and now
here's the fun part because I'm putting
Mayo um I'm going to put mayo first cuz
the thing is if you put mayo last then
the Mayo is going to stick to whatever
you're putting it on there so you won't
be able to redig with the spoon all
right
so H stop it in the middle no you always
do it on the edge
thege put some mayo on
there all right done with the Mayo put
some avocado

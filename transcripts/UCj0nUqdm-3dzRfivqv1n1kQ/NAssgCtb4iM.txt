these mothers
are so tall guys
hey guys what's going on megan here all
right so the map of the day by the way
we're gonna do a different map every
monday if i can but the map of the day
human height at the age of 18 around the
world so for guys who were born in 1996
meaning this data was collected around
2014 but anyway so let's take a quick
look
and see where your country is by the way
human height is effective obviously
genetic factors but also nutrition so
caloric intake and most importantly
animal protein
right so the countries that have better
health care better nutrition
and a high intake of animal protein i
got to be taller
and there's a ton a ton of literature on
it so this is not a theory this has been
well researched as you can see here but
anyway so yeah so the countries who are
high in socioeconomic status can afford
a lot of animal protein you're going to
be tall on average then yourself to
factor in genetic reasons and things
like that for example you could feed a
pygmy all you want or the protein you
want they're still going to be short as
 uh they're going to be taller than
the average pig me but they're still
going to be short so that's where the
genetic factors come in um but anyway so
yes if your country is low somewhere
here don't get butt hurt just either
blame your parents or blame your mom for
giving you protein as a kid
all right let's start with the united
states
average height is about 177.
keep in mind so i don't have to keep
repeating this this is for guys that
were born in 1996. so average rather by
177 if you round it up if you convert
that to feet and inches it's about five
foot ten right again i'm rounding up
what's interesting though is in 1946 the
average height was about 176.8
so it's slightly increasing obviously
due to the fact as i mentioned earlier
such as nutrition and things like that
healthcare blah blah blah in canada
slightly taller than the usa 178
so these guys are five for 10 on average
without even having to round up
um so let's see
next country
let's finish america no actually yeah
let's do the the tall countries first um
we have australia 179
right so these guys are about 5 10 5 11.
we have the giants of europe
right where the average height is almost
511 which is insane and obviously some
countries are even taller than others on
average
so scandinavians we're not surprised
right tallest countries in the world
some of the countries in the balkan
region obviously tall as as well um
let's look at
let's look here france again 510 511
germany
tall ukraine very tall
some of the barking countries let's see
these are so tall guys
foot 11 is the average height look at
that 180.5
insane a land of giants
see as you can clearly see the tallest
country is obviously uh in europe right
the scandinavians and uh
northern europe and the barking region
let's look at the let's look at my
people up north right so let's see
uk you guys are 177.
all right so 510 if you round up
same thing ireland around the 510 region
iceland more giants
511 if you round up
um i'mma stop saying if you round up
just assume i'm rounding up or
down depending on what the number is in
centimeters
but yeah uh if you watch my strongman
videos i explain that that's one of the
reasons why a lot of strongmen come from
these countries anyway watch the video
uh let's see did i forget any uh
tallest countries
nothing else about it alright next let's
look at uh let's see south america
my latino let's see right
brazil
around 5 8
argentina obviously slightly taller but
also around five eight five nine
peru god damn
average height is five five
and i'm also gonna make a video
explaining why it's so low but uh i
already mentioned that before
uh let's see
bolivia
mexico
about five six and a half so let's round
it up to five seven
oh let's show some love to my
asian all right so china
the heidi is actually going up in uh in
asia it was 171.8 back then but i think
it's a bit higher now because i'm pretty
sure height is going up in uh in china
and uh
in parts of asia as again they're
improving on nutrition and the economy
and things like that but yeah so let's
round this up 172. so that five foot
seven rounding up to five foot eight
mongolia
five foot six and a half
india
five foot five i'm obviously not gonna
go into every country but let's uh let's
pick some notable ones where most of my
subscribers are from saudi arabia
you guys are around five six on average
in yemen the average height is short as
159.9 right so that's about five three
that's
yeah that's low iran you guys are pretty
tall
uh compared to your neighbors five foot
eight
and again east africa
five foot five and a half you could
round it up to five for six but again
keep in mind the tallest tribe in the
world is from that region right the
night loads i mentioned that in the
height video
these guys are legendary
right so the dinka tribe
blah blah all right let's look at west
africa see when i told you guys west
africans are sure you guys thought i was
capping west africans are short man it's
just the reason why you see a lot of
tall
uh west africans because guys you're not
in africa you you're in developed
regions you guys are in europe you guys
are in america so you're seeing
one you seen the ones who made it to
america so obviously that they're
already uh slightly higher in
socioeconomic status compared to the
rest of africa because not just anyone
can make it um and two you guys are
seeing the ones that where you know a
lot of them were raised in america or
raised in europe
so that's why you guys are seeing this
super tall west african descendants but
if you go to africa most
are short trust me that's why i spent
the first 11 years of my life
most of us are short in west africa even
if you don't count the pygmies right
well obviously the shortest people in
the world
um but again like i said due to
nutrition and
uh
some genetic factors but let's see uh
nigeria look at that guys
five foot five and that's the average
 height right so stop looking at
the outlier stop looking at the giannis
and you know all the tall nigerians or
west african descendants
these are the outliers most people in
west africa are short as again the
reason why african americans are taller
even in the west african descent is
because what i mentioned earlier better
nutrition better health care and also
their mix with your opinions whether you
want to accept that or not so it's a
combination of environmental factors and
obviously genetic factors and keep in
mind a lot of these short people you
know once you once you increase
nutrition and health care you know
heights going to go up we see that in uh
second and third generation
children right from immigrants when they
move to the uk or america they're taller
than their parents all right let's see
uh where i was born ivory coast see
short as average height is five
foot five and a half
see let's look at banan where my
father's from average height
five foot six if you round it up that's
the guy burkina faso where my mother's
from five foot six if you round it up
five four seven so you see west africans
are short guys of course there's some
outliers but you get the point uh let's
look at
cameroon five foot six that's where my
uncle's from right and you got congo see
so west africans are short guys and even
if you don't include the heart of the
pygmies in the average but before i wrap
the video up let's look at
there we go let's look at some of the
pacific islanders let me zoom this
in a little bit more here we go let's
look at fiji
or feet whatever you want to pronounce
it by the way watch my samoan video and
polynesian video whatever uh yeah so
173.9 so these guys are about five foot
eight and a half five for nine
and the average height in samoa is about
five foot nine five foot ten if you
round it out right so some tall
 uh compared to the rest of
the world but anyway guys that's it let
me know which map you want to go over

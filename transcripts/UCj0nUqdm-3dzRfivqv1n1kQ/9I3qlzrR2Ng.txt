hey guys what's going on megan here
holy cow darren yates
posted this on his facebook today and oh
my god
look at the cat this is his daughter by
the way no clue how she is
probably a teenager late teens early 20s
no clue but
look at her calves calf genetics
for days she has better calves
than 95 of us out there and if you add
black people
she has better calves than 99 of us
right because we have the worst scaf
genetics in the world
and if you read his caption she doesn't
even train cavs
but anyway this is another episode of
fun fact friday it's funny i was gonna
make a completely different topic and i
was like no i gotta talk about this one
but anyway check out the playlist check
out the series
this is where we talk about random stuff
usually relating to genes across the
world different ethnicities different
races whatever the [ __ ] you want to call
it
but this is the stage where we just talk
about genetics and fun facts
make sure you watch the previous
episodes we covered asians uh central
europe
east africa west africa uh polynesians
the pacific islands southern europe
native americans you name it right and
there are more coming up on obviously
indians and
eskimos and all the other [ __ ] but
anyway back to this picture guys see
this
goes back to what i was telling you
about genetics right
people always want to argue with me
about how oh it's all about hard work
it's all about how hard you train
shut up guys obviously hard work plays a
role in life right no one is going to
deny that
but you cannot rule out genetics
jeans are so freaking important she
doesn't even
train cavs and she has better calves
than most of us right she obviously
inherited her father's
amazing calf genetics by the way for
those of you who don't know
darwin yates is one of my favorite
bodybuilders of all time
my old subscribers already know you know
my top five is obviously
number one is johnny jackson number two
is kevin levrone
number three is bird of fox number four
is ronnie coleman
and number five is dorian yates right
he's my top five
favorite battles of all time and if you
notice this list mainly because of his
traps right you guys know i'm a sucker
for traps
i'm a traps [ __ ] if you have big traps
i'm swiping right on tinder every time
pause all right so let's go back to
darnier's look at his calves
back in his prime guys look at this [ __ ]
man it's almost as
big as his [ __ ] upper legs obviously
they're a bit closer to the camera but
you get the [ __ ] point
and if you study him he didn't really
train cavs that hard you know again keep
in mind it's one of my favorite
bodybuilders so i used to watch all his
videos all his stuff
all his material all his interviews when
i was younger he didn't even train cavs
that hard
mainly genetic look at this
look at this guys his best body part by
far was again his back that's what he
was known for i'm sorry i love during
his but he was [ __ ] everything else
right
he had a shitty chest shitty midsection
shitty legs but he was the goat when he
came to
back triceps and calf development right
those were his three main body parts
look at his calves right his back he
actually had to train a lot hard for
that right because i actually saw his
progress when i was a kid right he's
back in 92 93 completely different
than what it was in his early years so
he actually had to train for his back to
look like that
right but his calves he always had
amazing calves
and sure enough he passed on those genes
to his kid
guys remember athletic performance is
mainly genetics
it's mainly genetics right so many
studies have confirmed this
see 66 of the variance is due to genetic
factors
that means the correlation is about 0.8
that's insane
right so whenever you have great
athletes uh people in sports
in whatever anything that requires elite
physical performance most of that is
genetics the rest is obviously drugs and
training and nutrition and all that but
it's mainly genetics that's why
the average person i don't care how hard
you train i don't care how much you do
nucleus overload i don't care how much
train you inject
you're never going to look like ronnie
coleman darwin yates
or the elite guys right it's mainly
genetics
that's why if you notice a lot of
athletes if you look at their
their their dad or their their
grandparents or even their siblings
you also see genetic freaks you know
kind of like the rock's dad
kind of like the gronkowski brothers you
know if you look at most genetic freaks
in uh
in sports if you look at their relatives
chances are you're also going to find a
genetic freak
somewhere in there jeans jeans jeans
i mean let's go back to the to the
father himself right look at his scaves
and he's retired this guy hasn't the
last time he was on the olympia stage
was 1997.
but look at his calves you think he
still trains
his scabs as hard as he used to back in
the days hell no right
even if he's on i mean i don't know if
he's on trt or whatever but even if he's
on trt or
any other pd's do you think he's
blasting as hard as he was back in the
days [ __ ] all right
but yet he still has better calves
than some bodybuilders was still
competing to the state
and back to his daughter look she has
better calves than
99 of elite marathon runners you guys
know i made a video about east africa
and how to dominate marathon events and
stuff like that and
in a video i explained right to be a
good marathon runner you gotta have [ __ ]
gaps most black people have [ __ ] gaps
right because for every genetic
advantage there's a trade-off right
having big calves slows you down when
you're doing long distance running
having high calves right meaning you
have a long-ass tendon
allows you to run extremely economically
that's why if you notice some of the
best runners have high calves right
east africans and west africans there
goes a different angle here
look at this she has better calves than
a whole grown
man and even if you look at you saying
both right let's go over to west african
descendants
who dominate the spring events the short
distance events right
look this is usain bolt fastest men in
the world
you see high-ass calves long-ass
tendon you see this right there she has
bigger calves
right then usain bolt obviously there's
some fat around here but you get the
[ __ ] point even if you look at just
the muscle
come on and what are you guys going to
blame it on right
you don't tell me the shoes on shoes on
the juice because there's over someone
in my comment section whenever i point
out genetics they're like oh it's just
royce
as if all of us can take roy's and look
like during yates
as if all of us can take [ __ ] primo
bowling d-ball
and [ __ ] decca and look like ronnie
coleman that's just not how the body
works guys steroids just enhance
your genetic potential but you can say
she was on trend
or what his [ __ ] years of steroid
usage went down to his balls into his
sperm cells and somehow
came out in his kid come on guys like
stop arguing with genetics man genetics
are so
crucial right anyway guys don't want to
keep you guys too long about to go spend
some time with the kid
and enjoy my weekend but in the meantime
remember genetics first
hard work second no matter what you do
in life
always pick a field in which you have a
genetic advantage
on which you can then add your ad work

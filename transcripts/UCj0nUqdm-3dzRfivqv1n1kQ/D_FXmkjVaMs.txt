hey guys what's going on megan here all
right you guys have been asking for this
challenge for over a year now so let's
rank the top 20 strongest body
characters based on physique right and
obviously we're going to use a
bodybuilding uh standard right so
combination of mass symmetry and
conditioning how to capitalize the top
20 because there's no inherent ranking
every single character
all right so once again i'm about to
knock category best of the best fit
amazing second best okay it's average
bad pure garbage if your favorite
character is not here don't get bought
her just try to figure out where he's
gonna land based on what you see here
all right so let's get started with spec
we're gonna put him in
like an amazing category obviously
buffer [ __ ] thick neck right you guys
know i'm a sucker for traps right i love
mass monsters thick neck thick traps
deaths upper chest you name it right so
that whole region
so the moment somebody shows up with
that braley neck that those bradley
traps you already know they're going to
go in [ __ ] amazing
next chaos is probably going to go
uh let's see chinook is going to go
[ __ ] amazing right he you know he has
a nice tight waist jack upper body uh
it's not as buff as a spec but again
[ __ ] amazing he has that the best
thing he has going for him is that waist
really tight waist buff all around
though next we have dorian not dorian
yates but he's gonna go same thing
[ __ ] amazing mass monster buffer [ __ ]
this one was easy next gaia guy is going
to go okay all right i know you guys
like the
the slam rip you know frank zane
physiques but again if you've been a
subscriber of mine for a long time you
know how to [ __ ] with that [ __ ] you got
to bring the mass monster look so i'm
gonna put him out okay all right
uh next you have the simp himself
i'm so mad at how much this [ __ ] on his
character but
i'm gonna put junior at i mean y'all
gonna hate me for this i'm gonna put him
at the top of okay right so better than
gaia but i can't put him in [ __ ]
amazing he's just not i mean don't get
me wrong you know he he has gained he
has gains right he doesn't include
overload but he's not a mass monster
right he's not on [ __ ] trend right
he's probably on annabelle winstrol or
something like that
so we're going to put him out okay right
i i really want him to be buff as [ __ ]
next you have a roach guys orochi is
buff as [ __ ] right but he's just stocky
man his waist is too wide he doesn't
have that that small waist um
again we got to be fair too because he's
old as dirt but i'm going to put him
uh
somewhere in here right between
the simp
right between muhammad ali and uh
waimanali junior and guy all right
because again he has the gains he has
the mass
sold on the [ __ ] but
he's just too stocky right he has the
[ __ ] waist
um and obviously he's super short next
goku you guys already know goku is going
to pure garbage man i don't give a [ __ ]
right i won't give a [ __ ] yes you know
we have to factor in his age and all
that but hey we got to equalize
everybody here
no one gets special treatment so pure
garbage if you [ __ ] want to
look like him good for you he didn't do
necklace lord one day in his [ __ ]
life all right next katsumi is gonna go
out okay same thing right he's gonna go
out okay a little buffer then gaia but
right nothing nothing really super
impressive about his physique for baki
standards obviously compared to irish
person it's not okay but you guys know
what i mean right we comparing them
based on bodybuilding
trend out of your [ __ ] mind next
man the
funny thing about carl is that when he's
wearing his suit he just looks fat as
[ __ ] right looks like it's been on the
mean perma bulk but when he takes out
the suit he looks completely different
for some reason right
so
man i want to put in my [ __ ] amazing
uh
but fine fine i'm putting at the bottom
of [ __ ] amazing all right really buff
thick neck big traps yeah his waist is a
little large but not as large as a roche
sword i'm gonna leave him up there
next guys you already know where jack is
going right [ __ ] amazing right don't
even play with me guys jack honma
[ __ ] amazing this guy is on
everything tran decker d-ball chess

physique is impressive this guy

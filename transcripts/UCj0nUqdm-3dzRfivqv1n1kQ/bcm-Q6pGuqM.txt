hey guys what's going on megan here top
tier tuesday you guys voted for
most anabolic vegetables so let's get
straight to it
keep in mind when i say anabolic i'm
referring to nutrient density in this
case
since vegetables are not very high in
leucine so
we focus on the ones that are very high
in vitamins and minerals and that are
obviously going to help facilitate the
hypertrophy process
also keep in mind i'm limiting this list
to only 25
else it's going to be way too long so
the top 25 most common
vegetables i'm not going to go over
things that are high in carbs such as
beans and potatoes because i already
covered those in the most anabolic carb
video
also last note if i put something in bad
it doesn't mean that it's bad by itself
obviously every vegetable out there has
its own benefits
it just means relative to the other
items on the list
it ranks lower all right so don't get
butt hurt if you see your favorite
vegetable in the lower category
all right let's get to it cucumbers are
going in bad again
as far as nutrient density carrots are
also going to go in bad unfortunately
again very high in vitamin a but as far
as overall nutrient density
not as high as they should be bell
peppers are going to go in okay
very high in vitamin c asparagus is
going to go in [ __ ] amazing mainly
because it has some
active sterol not a lot but some but if
it wasn't for that i'm definitely going
okay
broccoli is also going to go in [ __ ]
amazing mainly because it is high in so
many nutrients and it also has some
estrogen management properties
peas are going to go in bad in fact
these are the only ones i was going to
put in pure garbage as far as nutrient
density so you know what pure garbage
keep in mind a delicious store i [ __ ]
love peas but we got to be objective for
this list
brussels sprouts are going to go in the
okay category
mushrooms are going to go in okay i was
going to put them in bad but because
they have a little bit of a dysterone
very small amount that's going to bump
them up to okay but again they're high
in other things
mustard greens are gonna go in [ __ ]
amazing very very high
nutrient density beet greens are gonna
go in [ __ ] amazing
same reason lettuce depending on what
type of lettuce
for example leaf lettuce and romaine
lettuce [ __ ] amazing
meanwhile iceberg lettuce will be a bit
lower
but to avoid confusion i'm just gonna
put that okay
on average they are okay celery believe
it or not i want to put that one at bat
right
again it has its benefits but compared
to the other items on the list i just
can't put it up here
zucchini same thing i'm gonna put it at
bad not too dense in nutrients
relative to the other items on the list
chicory is
very high in nutrient density [ __ ]
amazing
green beans i'm sorry i'm gonna put
those are bad they were [ __ ]
overrated when we were kids and then you
get older and find out they're not even
that high no train density
cabbage is going to go in okay right
next to brussels sprouts
i will put it higher because it's a
cruciferous veggie but
it's not on the level of the guys up
here and that is [ __ ] amazing
cauliflower pretty much same family as
broccoli so we're gonna put it up here
[ __ ] amazing as well
parsley [ __ ] amazing very very high
nutrient density
seaweed i was gonna put it at [ __ ]
amazing because again it's very high in
minerals
also higher nitrogen for your thyroid um
this one is a tough one right i don't
want to put in okay because it's so much
better than these
and i don't want to put in [ __ ]
amazing because that's kind of an insult
to those guys i'm just going to put at
the top of the okay list
switch chart i'm going to put that in
[ __ ] amazing easy
very very high nutrient density
watercress obviously in i'm about
nut category it is actually the most
nutrient dense
vegetable in this entire list only issue
is not too many stores carry it in the
united states
collard greens go into [ __ ] amazing
category not only it tastes good but
very high in nutrients
spinach you guys already know the deal
i'm a watercress get the [ __ ] out here
right here
i'm about to another category spinach is
high
in so many things it's not even funny
guys look up
almost every important vitamin and
mineral and you'll see that spinach is
in the top five or at least the top ten
vitamin a vitamin k magnesium you name
it spinach is
loaded i mean loaded with nutrients
not to mention yours truly egg this
throne so
i'm about to not if i could only eat one
vegetable for the rest of my life would
be spinach
and obviously cal is also in i'm about
to not category cal
is loaded with nutrients the only reason
why spinach is higher is because of like
this throne
but all right guys that's it there goes
you i'm about to another category if
you're focusing on an antibiotic meal
plan
focus on the ones in the top two
categories the ones at the bottom don't
hurt
but if you want the most bang for your
buck keep in mind this is to maximize
muscle growth
by optimizing your levels of vitamins
and minerals this is not for fat loss if
this was for fat loss
the list would be a bit different since
obviously we want to focus on
what has the lowest amount of calories
per serving
so maybe one day i'll do uh most
important vegetables for fat loss but
anyway that's it guys hope this video

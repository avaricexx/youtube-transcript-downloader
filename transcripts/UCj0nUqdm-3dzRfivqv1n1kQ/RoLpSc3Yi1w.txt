hey what's going on megan here quick
video on um sleep right
now i made one a few weeks ago actually
a few months ago on um
on the importance of sleep so if you
want more details you want a longer
version you want to know the mechanism
behind it go check out that video
but i have to bring this topic up again
because if you know me you know i'm a
big proponent of sleep right i i won't
shut up about it
um and i believe that if you're natural
you just cannot compromise
your sleep right um i actually have it
at the top
of my anabolic ladder you know all out
of all the things you can do to maximize
muscle growth as a natural trainee sleep
is at the top
right and after that you have water
intake and protein and everything else
right
to me everything else comes second you
cannot
mess with sleep um but again when you
watch that the longer video i explain
why on you know the science and the bro
science behind it
but let's take a look at this study here
because i have to bring this topic back
up because
uh my clients will tell you you know
every sunday when we're doing a report
that's one of the first things i ask is
how was your sleep how was your sleep
how was your sleep
um and in the comment section it's the
same thing people are asking well what's
the optical amount what's the optimal
amount how much should i sleep
um and is it really that important so
let's take a look at this study but
all right so back to our video right so
this study here two weeks and i've used
this in the past
i've mentioned this a million times but
like i said i need to bring this up
again two weeks of dieting
um you have two groups obviously one
group slap eight and you know 8.5 hours
the other group slap 5.5 hours right
and i'm gonna put the details of the
study in the description you know obese
individuals blah blah blah
now check this out look at the results
after just two weeks
right both groups lost three pounds
right about three pounds of
um of weight but look at the body
composition look at
where most of the weight loss came from
the group who slept eight and a half
hours
right as you can see here this this
group here
red is muscle mass and obviously uh blue
is fat mass right
so roughly an equal amount right it was
almost half and half right so this is
the group who slept
eight and a half hours out of the three
pounds that they lost
it was almost half and half right now
check out the group
uh that slapped only five and a half
hours they also lost three pounds
but look where most of the weight loss
came from it was mostly muscle mass
right which is why i kept telling you
guys you cannot play around with sleep
and the difference of sleep was only
three hours but that three hour
difference
the body catabolized mostly muscle
tissue
right and i have a lot of people out
there who are only sleeping five four
hours a day and i know how important
this is because like i said i was one of
those guys you know when i was in
college and i was
you know i was stressed to the max and
you know some
working and managing all these different
things being a father blah blah blah
i my sleep was horrible right and that's
when i lost the majority of my gains and
that's also when i put on the most fat
you know that's why i keep telling you
guys uh the calorie in calorie out
 keep driving me insane
right because it's not that simple yes
obviously the end result is you want to
be in a deficit when you're trying to
lose weight everyone knows that right
you know you're not going to go against
the level of physics
that's the end result but the means to
get there
is very very important you can't just
say i'm going to go in the deficit and
everything's going to fight yeah you're
going to lose weight
but as far as body composition goes if
you don't
optimize the other factors right like
sleep and things like that
you're going to lose weight but look
your body composition is going to be
 right
because who wants to lose three pounds
and have the majority that come from
muscle
right so yeah you know at the end of the
day scaling calorie out but most of that
calorie out
came from muscle tissue right that's
like you're telling you yes
you you know you want to look at your
calorie intake yes you want to you know
look at your energy balance but you also
have to
to look at other factors such as protein
intake macros
micros and most importantly sleep look
at that and that's why i always joke
around and say sleep is like you know
the legal steroid
right because there's nothing more
anabolic outside of ivc training
there's nothing more anabolic for a
natural person
and sleep and i give the example in the
other video you know
and i told you guys why do you think the
time in your life when you put on the
most muscle mass which is actually when
you're a baby believe it or not
when you're a baby that's actually when
you put under most muscle mass babies
double in muscle mass not fat mass
pure lean muscle mass from the time
they're born
uh to about six months after that right
and the time in your life when you put
on the most muscle is when you sleep the
most that's all babies do is just sleep
sleep sleep sleep
right it's crucial for mental and
physical development
and if a baby doesn't get enough sleep
they barely put on enough you know
enough weight even though they eat the
same so you cannot
underestimate the importance of sleep
guys now most of the complaints that i
get about people who don't get enough
sleep
it's mainly because of lifestyle factors
right you have work i mean look at the
society we live in you have you know
most people just overburdened with work
uh too much stress um and if you in that
situation you know just
look for a way around that you know
especially if you're trying to maximize
muscle
uh muscle mass or you're going on a cut
and things like that now the other group
of people which i have no sympathy for
are guys who are just up all night
playing video games right
don't email me and message me and tell
me that you're struggling with weight
loss or putting on muscle mass
if the number one reason why you're not
getting enough sleep is cause you're up
all night playing fortnite or
whatever new game is out there right so
you see the video games all night
or netflix right watching tv till two
o'clock in the morning
and then waking up at like 5 6 7 and
wondering hey you know i don't know i
don't know i'm skinny fat i'm doing
everything else right
you know you have to optimize sleep guys
and it was another study for those of
you who might think but that one was
only two weeks let's look at a long-term
study
this one here now this could be eight
weeks of dieting
right and it's interesting because this
group look the difference of sleep was
only one hour you have a seven hour
group and a six side group
right and this group the six hour group
try to do catch up sleep meaning monday
through friday you know they didn't
sleep enough
but on the weekends they try to pretty
much catch up and the conclusion was
that it still doesn't make a
difference look the amount of fat loss
right
the percentage of fat loss from the
group that got seven hours of sleep
so out of all the weight that they lost
right the percentage
that came from fat was massive
this is from the group who slept seven
hours right and look how much muscle
mass they lost
now look at the group that only slap six
hours and try to do casual sleep on the
weekend
most of the weight that loss came from
muscle guys this is huge look at the
difference
and this is only a one hour difference
you cannot and this is an eight-week
study
the sample size was much larger than the
previous one right and i could i could
show you these studies all day there's
so many more right
but do you do you really need studies to
prove to you how important sleep is for
body composition
right i told you time and time again
my friends who sleep the most were also
the ones who were able to put on muscle
the faster you guys remember lazy lying
that's why we called him lazy lion
because he used to sleep so much
and when i put him on the same program
that i put everybody else on you know
nucleus of the law they just be training
blah blah blah
he grew like a wee even though he had
some of the worst genetics
same thing with muhammad and i was
mentioning these two guys because like i
said they had some of the worst genetics
you could think about
but one thing that they stayed
disciplined on was
sleep i told them guys you're not
sleeping don't even
don't even waste my time i'm not gonna
waste my time trying to train you guys
if you're not getting enough sleep
and the results speak for themselves you
could go back and see the old videos
from years ago you could see how fast
that grew you know
so so i'm not just being a dick i'm not
just being annoying when i keep
reminding you guys over and over in the
comment section
you know people ask me questions that
have nothing to do with sleep and my
answer will always be
how are you managing recovery how are
you managing sleep how are you managing
water
you know stop asking me all these
questions about progressive overload and
volume
and and and all these other things that
people think are so
 important when the recovery part
of the equation is lacking
it's all about recovery guys it's all
about recovery
once you're recovering well it's easy to
increase your volume it's easy to
progressively overload it's easier
to do everything else now keep in mind
those guys were obviously not
bodybuilders
you know obviously if they're trained
they would have retained more muscle
but also keep in mind that when you
train
the stress that you put on your body is
also higher right so in fact you need
more sleep when you train
right you're um you can't compare
yourself to obviously they're using
uh regular people in these studies or
based individuals and blah blah blah
but you can't just say well you know i
kind of work out so that's fine well no
because if you train you also need more
sleep you can't compare yourself to the
average person you can't say
well every person just needs to buy
seven or eight hours of sleep i'm gonna
do the same thing no you're not the
average person you train
especially if you do uh full body
workouts or if you do nuclear silver
load
or even if you do just high volume
splits right you're putting a
uh greater than than normal stress on
your body
so the need for recovery goes up right
and that includes sleep
so in fact with training you have to
sleep more right that's why i keep
telling people like hey if you're
training
you're lifting weights you training hard
high volume
high intensity high frequency you need
even more sleep
but yet people who train balls to the
wall
are sleeping just as much as the average
person
just use common sense you will not get
optimal results doing that
recovery is kind guys so in fact i
recommend
at least eight hours of sleep for people
who train and when i say at least again
when i say at least that's the minimum
meaning that's a bad day meaning you had
a bad day uh
something happened and the lowest amount
of sleep you're able to get
is eight for some reason whenever i tell
people at least they think that's the
goal all right i'm gonna go for eight no
no eight is the bare minimum try to get
ten
try to get nine you know add some naps
on top of that right
but as far as night undisturbed sleep
you definitely wanna get
about eight to ten right no less than
eight ideally
nine ten your body needs it and then
throughout the day if you can take some
naps
you'd be amazed at the improvements you
make not only in your body composition
but in your strength your strength is
gonna go up
uh your ability to do volume is gonna go
up you'll be able to tolerate more
volume
and remember strain volume all those
things are components of progressive
overload so
you're going to get the most out of your
program by increasing your sleep
now if you're looking for tips on how to
improve sleep uh
again i mentioned that in a in a
previous video um so go check that one
out
but quick recap number one go to bed
early
obviously right don't try to stay up
till you know midnight one or two
o'clock in the morning
go to bed early number two try to train
earlier in the day
right because obviously if you train too
late
your sympathetic nervous system is going
to be firing like crazy it's going to be
hard for you to fall asleep you're going
to have adrenaline
going through your body um your dopamine
is going to be a bit too high
your adrenals are going to be firing try
to train a bit early this way
when the evening comes it's time to cool
down and wind down
and if you guys know what i'm talking
about when you have a crazy intense
workout late in the day it's almost
impossible to fall asleep also keep in
mind that if you're training too late
and you take pre-workout it's loaded
with caffeine so that's going to keep
you up
number three obviously turn the lights
off early so around you know
let's say two three hours before you go
to bed turn the lights off right it's
gonna help your body produce melatonin
and the lights that include your your
phone that includes your laptop your
computer
all of this number four blast the
ac right turning on the ac is gonna help
you fall asleep right
you guys what i'm talking about in the
winter time when it's cold as
people have no issues falling asleep you
know it's cold as hell you just go in a
blanket
boom you're knocked out in a matter of
minutes another thing you can do is hot
showers
hot showers help you fall asleep for
most people right take a really hot
shower
and turn on the ac go into the blankets
boom
uh another thing is coffee like i
mentioned earlier trying to drink coffee
in the afternoon
because obviously coffee has a very very
very long uh half-life right it's going
to stay in your system a lot longer than
you think
another thing you can do is music i
don't know about childhood music helps
me fall asleep
um and it also works for a lot of people
depending on what kind of music you put
right don't
don't try to use uh metallica
you know crazy ass death metal
uh hardcore music that that shit's not
gonna work right try to listen to
something relaxing try classic music
that helps a lot another thing you can
do is audiobooks right
audiobooks usually knock people the
out right especially if you uh
don't like to read and it's a win-win
scenario right
you're getting your reading in right
through the audio book
and if you fall asleep great if you
don't fall asleep your knowledge gains
are going up
and like i mentioned in the other video
uh sex
sex helps a lot you know i don't know
about y'all but i get very sleepy
um after i smash most people have the
same
reaction right most people are sleepy
after sex so
sleep uh eat your meat whatever you
gotta do
um to knock yourself out and last but
not least is melatonin right try
supplementing with melatonin
but try to avoid having to rely on
melatonin right that's like the last
last resort right you guys know i'm not
a big fan of
supplements when something could be done
naturally so only try melatonin if
nothing else works
but that's it hope this video helps i
have
i might do an faq this friday don't
quote me on that because i'm very busy

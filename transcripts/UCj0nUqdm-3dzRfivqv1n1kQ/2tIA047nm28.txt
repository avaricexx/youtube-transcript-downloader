hey guys what's going on megan here
figured i'd drop another video on sunday
for sunday studies let's take a look at
this one look at the insane gains
between the nucleus of a little slash
bfr group
and the normal training group right all
right once again uh if you've been
living on iraq and you're not familiar
with nuclear civil law just watch my
other videos on it but by now you should
already know what the [ __ ] it is right
i'm gonna put the links uh on the screen
on the description but long story short
it's the program i designed
years ago um based on years and years of
observation
not name the nucleus of the law because
the goal is to increase the [ __ ] out of
the satellite cells
and nuclei within your muscle leading to
faster growth but anyway so let's take a
look at this study
all right so this was 19 days of high
frequency bf4 right guys remember
um there are many many ways to apply
nucleus overload
blood flow restriction is just one of my
favorite methods because you don't need
a lot of weight
um but remember you don't have to use
blood flow restriction i always get this
question
in the comment section blood flow
restriction is only good if using very
very light weights which i normally
don't recommend right you want to use a
weight that you could do
anywhere from 15 to 20 reps but no more
than 30
but if you decide to use a weight that's
lighter than that then that's when you
want to use blood flow
so it's up to you right zero difference
between bf4 and normal training
um if you're using a normal weight
anyway so this study was comparing to
groups one group was obviously doing bfo
and the other group was doing
um just you know light ass weight which
we all know success right
again unless you're using before but
anyway so we focused on the results of
group one forget about group two we know
they're not gonna build muscle anyway
but yeah so let's take a look at group
one's results because those were insane
and they just show you how powerful
nucleus overload is if it's done
correctly
now first does it qualify as a nucleus
of little study and i will tell you guys
for a training program to qualify as
nuclear overload it has to meet
four basic requirements right or at
least three out of four
one it has to be very very high
frequency right so at least
at least three times a week up to
obviously seven
depending on your ability to recover and
yes this study was
they did 23 sessions in 90 days right so
obviously some days i did more than one
session a day so pretty much five days a
week
so that falls into that range next it
has to be very high weekly volume at
least again keyword at least
20 sets per week ideally more right i
usually recommend about
five sets a day for as many days as you
can recover from
and sure enough they did over 30 sets
per week
third pillar of nucleus will load is has
to be either very high reps or very high
time on the tension right
maximizing the pump and so enough again
first set was 40 reps second one was 12
8 6 again 30 second rest in between
once again the goal to maximize the pump
so this met
73 out of the four biggest pillars in
the casualty now the last pillar very
high recovery so the amateur reset
period
this one did not have an amateur reset
very simply because they were just
trying to
actually study different things they
wanted to see the difference between bfr
and non-bfr
on satellites and things like that so
they didn't really do the mtor reset but
that's fine because
at least we get to see uh the effects of
the first three pillars
and again i already mentioned the other
studies where they actually did the mtor
reset and you guys know how that turned
out
all right now look at the results guys
this is time adjusted gains by the way
it's a muscle fiber area time adjust
again if you have to adjust for time
right you can't compare uh studies if uh
you know let's say one is eight weeks
one is twenty weeks you can't be like
well look this study did more gays or
this one like you gotta address for time
obviously so anyway so look here so this
is the nucleus of a little group right
the blood flow restriction very high
frequency group
and um this is how much gains they put
on right again this is time adjusted
now compare this to the normal training
group right keep in mind guys
most studies or you know most training
interventions
if you're putting on 15 to 20 percent uh
more gains in mfa right most fiber area
that is huge that's considered
you know pretty [ __ ] good right so 18
uh is the sweet spot and that comes out
to about 1.3
1.5 per week right on average
if you have elite genetics right so
based on studies that looked at people
that are very very high responders elite
genetics
but these guys were putting on about 37
increases in mfa right so that comes out
to about 2.3 2.5 percent gains per week
on average right if you're just for time
look at the [ __ ] results of the
nuclear civil law bfr group right
in [ __ ] saying guys and again i'm
going to put the study in the
description you guys could check it out
yourself you can analyze it run the
numbers yourself blah blah
right look at the difference put on
about 30 to 40 so about 35
in just 19 days and here's the crazy
thing about that because somebody might
think well
there's probably inflammation nope they
actually measure the gains
after inflammation and after cell
soiling went down
and that's what makes the study so
amazing is because again these guys are
not idiots they know that eventually if
you're training with that kind of volume
you're gonna have some kind of swelling
right so what they do is they actually
wait until the swelling goes down it's
usually after three days or so
sometimes they wait even 10 days they'll
wait until the the swelling goes down
they wait until
uh everything is accounted for so you
know increasing water mass water
retention things like that and then they
measure
so even after you account for all of
these factors nucleus overload destroys
every other training method once you're
just for time and again
the results was mainly due to the
frequency remember it wasn't due to the
bf4 because like i said that's what i
tell you guys bf is optional you don't
have to do it because
uh they did a lot of follow-up studies
where they compared uh using bfr
and people that were already using
enough weight so you know lifting
anything
higher than 40 of your one-way max and
once you equate frequency and equate
volume there's zero difference
zero difference so the main advantage
the main reason
behind the discrepancy in uh in size
gains
comes from the frequency these people
are training twice per week
once or twice per week whereas in a
higher frequency studies it's obviously
at least three to five times per week
and these results were replicated
over and over and over again so it's not
all the simple styles were small or
maybe it was a oh you can't look it up
yourself
these are replicated plenty of times
next look at the increase in satellite
cells again the main reason behind
nuclear solar guys remember that's why i
called it nucleus overload right kind of
like information overload meaning too
much information
testosterone overload too much
testosterone nucleus overload too many
nuclei
so once again the proof that legal solo
works
when you look at a molecular level look
at the increase that again time adjusted
right
increase in satellite cells over 280
percent
right and if you're just that per week
again time addresses that was about
245 percent by week one which is insane
prior to this the biggest spike we've
ever seen in satellite cells
was about 150 and they had to do um
damaging exercise really damaging
exercise because you guys know that
two-way synchrocellular cells
inflict very heavy damage on the muscle
which is not optimal for growth or
doing high frequency training whereas in
this group they achieved that without
doing substantial damage to the muscle
for those who don't know too much damage
is actually bad for muscle gains
and that's the beauty of nuclear silver
load is you actually reducing
the amount of damage you're causing to
the muscle allowing most of the protein
synthesis to go towards muscle growth as
opposed to
recovery from damage so anyway so back
to this all right so to about 245
percent time interest to gain in
satellite cells
this is only about by week one whereas
normal training you lucky
um if you get 30 to 50 increase in
satellite cells that's what we usually
see if you look at all the
the dozens and dozens of studies on
satellite cells about 30 to 50 percent
is the sweet spot
and this is after weeks of training all
right so that comes out to about ten
percent more sure just for time
right so massive massive difference so
again why are the faster gains why does
nuclear silver load work so [ __ ] well
i told you guys the growth factors that
emerge from training have a very very
short half-life especially once you make
it past
the newbie stage right so if you've been
training for a long time it's even
shorter
right so all these factors that
eventually and obviously you guys know
the protein synthesis response from
training which is again when muscle's
actually being built
extremely extremely short duration about
12 to 16 hours if you're a very very
trained individual
right and that's why steroids work so
well right because they allow you to
keep all these factors elevated for an
extended period of time that's why if
you're on steroids or you have really
really really good genetics
you can train once a week and make
amazing gains well guess what
most of you guys are not on steroids and
don't have elite genetics
so you have to manually keep your growth
factors up regulated
which is why high frequency and high
weekly volume is so [ __ ] important
and that's why i made
so so many gains once i started
implementing
nucleus overload and obviously full body
workout hdp training
the whole nine yards right remember guys
i have some of the shittiest genetics on
youtube
remember i picked that two years right
after two years of training this is what
i [ __ ] look like i know people have
been training for
less than three [ __ ] months and look
better than i looked after two years of
training
and i was doing everything i read in
magazines you know bro split
uh progressive overload lift heavy uh
train only once a week right because you
know you don't over train you know all
that [ __ ]
right and it's not until i started doing
full body workouts nucleus overload
and obviously milk and my mic is
optional but you guys know that's my
baby right there
um because i have a shitty appetite so
again watch my mug video
this part is optional but that's when i
started to [ __ ] take off
just like the studies show just like the
overwhelming anecdote show
so there you have it i could make so
many more videos on this because there
are so many studies now
on nucleus i'm so excited because you
guys know back in the days everyone used
to say it was bro science right now that
there are so many [ __ ] studies on it
i absolutely love it because now it's no
longer what millions just spit in our
theories no it's
facts that are replicated over and over
again so try that guys remember guys
it's free you have nothing to [ __ ]
lose it's free try it out if it doesn't
work or well megan [ __ ] lies you
don't have to use my program you could
pick any full body routine as long as
it meets the basic requirements of
muscle growth combining with nucleus
overload
you will make gains alright guys that's
it and don't forget the top 10 nucleus

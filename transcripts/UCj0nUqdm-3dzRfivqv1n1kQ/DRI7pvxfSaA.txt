hey guys what's going on megan here
joelle
stubs the third best back in
bodybuilding history
i mean what the [ __ ] by the way this
segment is gonna focus on
all the craziest things in the
bodybuilding universe
and it's not just limited to
bodybuilders i don't care if it's an
animal i don't care if it's a
uh a natty a guy on roids
anything related to muscle growth that's
outside of the ordinary is going to be
featured on this segment
so send them over guys this is going to
be a segment
solely dedicated to madness so today
we're going to focus on drew our stubs
a lot of the og's know him in fact even
the new guys know him i mean when you
when you look up best back in history
he's definitely in the top five i'll put
him at number three
i mean just look at this back
development look at those wings guys
back to js first let's run a quick scan
all right 295 pounds that's about the
heaviest he competed on stage
uh some sources say 300 some 290 so
we'll put him in the middle at 295 which
is insane
now of course he's 6'3 so that allows
them to carry a lot more mass than the
average person
but that's still a very very very
impressive uh
contest weight to give you an idea he
has a fat free mass
index of 35 which is massive remember
ronnie coleman is at around 39
so he's very very close to ronnie
coleman as far as uh
fairfield max goes now i know what you
guys are going to say
oh man look at his legs guys remember
this guy had an injury
while playing basketball right so [ __ ]
up both of his legs
and that obviously held him back in fact
that's one of the reasons why in fact
the main reason why he didn't really
place higher
uh in the olympia is mainly because of
his legs but if it wasn't for that
injury just i mean just imagine
the damage this guy would have done i
mean look at these wings and speaking of
wings guys
isn't ironic he's actually a pilot from
the bahamas
he's an ironic how one of the best wings
the best lats in history
right uh belong to a pilot but anyway
let's take a look at some pictures you
know this i'm pretty sure again though
i've seen these pictures a million times
but jeez it just never gets old looking
at it
massive massive back and yes i don't
want to see
steroid comments in the in the uh in the
comment section of course these guys
aren't
on the juice it's like there's always
this one clown who goes on every video
that clearly shows reuter [ __ ]
ibb pros and says
well they're on steroids like no [ __ ]
thank you you just discovered something
that nobody else
alright we know these guys on the juice
that's i mean it's the whole point of
the ifbb right it's not a bunch of natty
guys running around
but steroids are not this is still a
very impressive back right not everybody
under juice
uh has his back development obviously he
genetics gave him uh
an advantage uh but jeez just look at
this
look at this like what is this right
he had to be on this episode of what the
[ __ ] wednesday i mean come on man it
just it's the first thing your eyes are
drawn to
massive massive lats the thickness the
width
let's look at this picture here and of
course those of you actually wondering
what his routine is like
yeah and that's how you know it's mainly
genetics right because his routine is
not that that much different than
um the rest of the bodybuilders he does
uh the one thing i give him though he
does a lot of pull-ups right which is
not surprising right the best exercise
for
for overall lat development it has a lot
of pull-ups different grips
you know it's funny how the best backs
in history
um except for maybe one which is during
years i did a lot of pull-ups
a lot of a lot of a lot of pull-ups but
other than that his routine is simple
you know
the typical rolls he has a heavy day and
a light day
but the one thing that stands out uh
compared to other
pro bodybuilders is the amount of
pull-ups he does
but anyway just look at this development
what the [ __ ]
right even his traps develop from the
back
even his deltoids it's funny because his
back is so impressive
that we don't even pay attention to how
big his other body parts are like again
his shoulders
if you can see here he doesn't look bad
from the front either you know he has a
decent sized chest you know he has both
the delts
you know pretty good physique from the
front but it's just your eyes are
immediately drawn
to his insane back development here's
another front picture you know look at
his shoulders you know he has some of
the
uh some of the bad shoulders you know
i'll definitely put him in the top ten
you know if you're talking about
shoulders
but it's funny when you say joel stubs
no one thinks his shoulders it's just
back back back development
and it never gets sold i've seen
pictures of this guy ever since i was a
teenager but yet that never get old
you got a picture here of him standing
next i think i believe that's cute
quincy taylor um and you can see i mean
you know qt doesn't have a bad back
either but
just look at the difference especially
in the lower lower back region
right development is out of this world
look at that christmas tree
obviously this is him in the real last
spread very hard to find good quality
pictures of him but i don't give a [ __ ]
i'll just grab whatever i can find
i mean look at these wings from a pilot
the irony like i said you know if it
wasn't for his uh
double leg injury this guy would have
been a threat
you know it would have been a threat of
course the reason why i put him at
number three as far as the best
what the [ __ ] backs of all time um it's
because
you guys already know who has the top
two spots right no one comes close to
these two
right ronnie coleman at number one right
best back in bodybuilding history period
ball nine his back is first second and
third place and it's not even up for
debate
and obviously you have during it's the
number two right and it's a close number
two you know so close number two is just
the reason why ronnie destroys them is
because of just uh the back thickness
right rodney's traps
have traps so it's it's just from the
back
it's almost impossible uh
to beat him in any back poses but yeah
these two are the reason why joelle
stuff does not have the best back in by
winning history
if it wasn't for them he'll definitely
be number one you know i mean just look
at this right
oh and they coming up they're definitely
coming up on one of the episodes of what
the [ __ ] wednesday right
i'm gonna do one on dorian yates one on
ronnie
and ronnie's gonna be on so many
episodes because he has so many what the
[ __ ] body parts you know
but i say guys comment below let me know
what you guys think about joel stars do
you think
he actually has the best back in history
or some claim do you think he's number
one number two
what do you think and also comment below
and let me know what you want to see
featured on the next episode
of what the [ __ ] wednesday remember it
doesn't have to be um
a knife bb pro right as long as it's
related to muscle growth and it's

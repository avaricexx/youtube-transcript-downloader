one two three hey guys going on Megan
here all right so let's take a look at
this poll and then I'm gonna answer some
frequently asked questions when I read
the comments all right how much
uninterrupted sleep do you get per day
for maximum testosterone and muscle mass
you guys know I have so many videos on
sleep going back like what over 10 years
but yet
look at this [ __ ]
right sleep which is again at the Sleep
water nutrient micronutrients at the
foundation of everything that has to do
with once again testosterone muscle mass
health whatever but yet look at this
look how many people are skipping the
basics
but I bet you if you're looking at stash
you're gonna find a [ __ ] ton of
supplements right skipping the basics
and then go and buy based on caffeine
and you know whatever look look at this
under seven hours of sleep guys again
watch my videos on sleep for more
details while going to the studies and
research whatever but just one night of
bad sleep is enough to [ __ ] you over so
much the following day cognition suffers
muscle metabolism suffers
um energy metabolism suffers brain fog
acetylcholine function I mean everything
you could think about goes south with
just one not a bad sleep
but somehow you guys managed to look 30
of you guys sleep under seven hours a
day 30 that's one third
one third
of you guys are in Smiggle category
right the average person needs at least
at least eight hours of sleep not seven
I'm gonna show you from the studies
people think oh there's another
difference between seven and eight is a
huge difference especially if you factor
in your REM Cycles sleep efficiency
right you guys need at least eight hours
because if you think you're getting
seven hours of sleep you're probably
getting six and a half nobody lays down
the bed and just automatically falls
asleep That's not including when you
wake up in the middle night and [ __ ]
what you shouldn't right most people
need eight to ten hours of sleep
depending on the person depending on how
how active you are how much you use your
brain throughout the day how hard you
train how much recovery you need
so how is it that 30 of you guys mostly
men are sleeping less than seven hours
and you wonder why your rate of muscle
growth is low your rate of strength
progress is low
you can't focus for [ __ ] you keep
thinking oh it must just be ADHD your
ADHD doesn't just come out of your ass
doesn't come out of nowhere
if your diet is trash your lifestyle is
trash trust me even if you don't have
the genetics if you're not genetically
disposed to ADHD or you don't have the
environmental trauma at least ADHD
you're still going to have ADHD symptoms
anyway
30 of you guys sleep less than seven
hours 26 percent get about seven hours
so look at that that is horrible that
means what 55 percent of men
at least from out of the five thousand
vote half of you guys are not even
getting enough sleep for proper function
seven is not enough now if you don't do
anything during the day you don't train
hard you don't do cognitive work
whatever yeah you could you could get by
them seven hours of sleep but
that's not most of the viewers on the
channel I'm pretty sure most of you guys
train hard right
I [ __ ] hope so that's why you're
watching my content but anyway
um 30 of men get eight hours and 14
percent get nine to ten hours right
ideally you want to be between here so
between eight and ten it's not every day
you're gonna get nine to ten especially
trust me I'm a dad if you're a family
man it's obviously older but you can't
make excuses you got to look for ways to
optimize your sleep guys
so if you do the running total
right half of men are not even getting
the amount of sleep that they need to
function anyway let's read the comments
all right let's look at the top comments
if I ever get my circadian rhythm in
order I'd be unstoppable I'm working yes
you will you will be [ __ ] Unstoppable
trust me guys oh just do one night of
good sleep and then measure your
testosterone that was the next day right
try to hand grip Swift test
right measure your hand grip right watch
the video I did about hand grip or read
the article I have on there I'm not
going to repeat it over and over again
but it is the best measure of your
testosterone levels and your Androgen
status which which your testosterone
levels do not measure obviously
um so yeah you see sleep good next
morning wake up
test your hand grip
sleep bad next morning wake up test your
hand grip night and day and sure enough
you could actually go to a lab and do
blood work and you see the perfect
correlation and causation obviously
um between hand grip and testosterone
how so many of the little things that
you guys [ __ ] up on during the day are
destroying your tea levels you know same
thing with eating bad you know but
anyway sweet is not about hand grip
strength it's about sleep
the best thing ever for my sleep was
getting a pet rabbit what they get up at
sunrise every morning so I get around
another time this evening on the rabbit
what the [ __ ]
um five hours of Love crafting Hardware
take it I leave
um I generally struggle with getting
more than six hours dude that's bad
that's bad I mean I could just just by
reading this by knowing how much you
sleep right I could I could guess your
entire blood work I could try to get
high quality so I'll probably be high
prolactin uh your adulation is all over
the place probably have a high extra
dollar obviously low total tea you
probably have low uh
low free tea highest hbg your T3 thyroid
is probably trash
um rt3 is going to be trash as well
because you call this was going to be
high your DHT is probably I mean I could
just predict your blood work just from
years and years and years and years of
experience and and coaching and looking
at blood work and and reading studies
and met analysis I could predict your
blood work just by looking at how much
you sleep
if I know how much you sleep and what
you're eating one day I could better
your whole [ __ ] life so this is bad
guys
um and most people who don't most people
who don't sleep enough don't realize how
much is hurting them you won't know why
because of caffeine because they take a
lot of caffeine and I think oh look I
have a lot of energy not knowing that no
you don't the caffeine is just blocking
your density receptors
giving you the illusion that you're not
tired you know if you sleep six hours a
day or less or even less than seven try
going two to three days without coffee
and you still have you see how horrible
you actually feel
so the coffee is not helping you it's
actually it's actually a Band-Aid
temporary solution it's masking the
fatigue but anyway
I picked seven not because the work of
school I just genuinely feel well rested
after 148 hours I mean if you guys again
if you sleep
and you wake up after seven hours and
you feel great then [ __ ] this poll do
what works for you that's my philosophy
do what works for you the advice that I
put on here is generic general advice
based on research and experience
but even when I'm working with clients I
have to tailor the advice to make it
specific to the person so if you sleep
and you feel great after seven hours and
keep in mind this is without caffeine
because like I said a lot of people say
oh I feel great but then you find out to
drink it like four cups of coffee if not
two cups of coffee no you don't feel
great
um but if you only need seven hours of
sleep to feel great to have high tea
um without needing caffeine and function
then hey well I'll try to sleep more
um how's it even possible to see more
than eight hours
um yeah yeah guys I mean it's hard trust
me I had insomnia my whole life so it's
very hard because I like to stay up very
late at night very often and fall asleep
but you can make it happen you know
um you can definitely do a lot of things
I have videos on how to you know face
your sleep right so don't make excuses
guys watch my videos on how to guarantee
you're gonna get at least eight if not
nine hours of sleep
how do we stay asleep longer than five
hours Megan watch my video on this
um uh pretty much make sure you're tired
that's rule number one like make sure
you talk you'll be surprised how many
people have a ton of energy at 9pm right
if you don't go to the gym if you don't
do if you don't walk you don't get your
ten thousand steps in or more
um you're not doing cognitive work
you're not working on your business
you're not doing things that actually
make you tired
how do you expect to fall asleep I
always say this you don't fall asleep
because you want to sleep you fall
asleep because you're tired
most of you guys struggle with sleep
because you're just not tired by bedtime
as simple as it sounds not to mention
the caffeine problem the sunlight in the
morning all these things and watch my
videos and sleep
um next uh describe undisrupted sleeves
as I wake up yeah guys you guys should
not wake up to go pee in the middle of
your night right because if you wake up
in the morning not to go pee you're not
getting it's not just about getting
eight hours of sleep it's about the
quality of the sleep you got to get all
those REM Cycles right with your 90
minute each
so if you wake up in a minute one of
your REM Cycles up you just [ __ ] that up
right so that's why I say eight to ten
hours it's not about the the total time
it's about the amount of time you need
to get all your REM Cycles some people
might get all the REM Cycles in seven
hours you know
um but that's rare so if you wake up to
go pee or somebody wakes you up or noise
wakes you up that's not good because
you're not getting all your REM Cycles
and look it is I need more REM sleep for
sure sleeping head I was a day but
probably should sleep yeah that's not
good and if you guys keep waking up to
go pee again it's easy just stop
drinking water close to bedtime uh make
sure you don't have prostate issues um
that could be a Cause right so do a PSA
test but uh yeah you should not wake up
in the middle of night to go pee
if it's a habit it might take a few days
to fix it but uh
definitely fix that not sure how much
sleep is just about oh my God oh my God
there goes like guys I think these guys
are doing on purpose they know how much
it [ __ ] triggers me so I think
they're doing on purpose there's always
this one guy in every video
oh my God
too much sleep is just as bad as for no
[ __ ] it is but anyway let's keep going
they're doing this [ __ ] on purpose you
just trigger me guys the reason why I
get so pissed at this because you'll be
I've been doing this for so long you'll
be amazed at how often I run into these
people
we just want to straw man everything and
pretend like there's no inverter you
curve to everything
but because I had one guy saying he goes
John he goes why do you get so mad at
this [ __ ] I'm like bruh you don't
understand how often I have to deal with
these stupid ass comments
too much sleep you're just better you're
not getting no sleep no [ __ ] you think
you can just sleep for 20 hours and feel
more refreshed
there's a reason why the poll even stops
at 10 I didn't put eight to twenty
and look at 15 other idiots licking his
balls but anyway
um nine hours most of the time my
schedule is pretty consistent I've been
bad about 10 B I wake up around six
nights nice yeah that's like if you go
to bed around nine or ten wake up around
six to seven oh that is perfect and you
see it you feel different your T levels
will be through the roof morning wood on
point hand grip strength on point
um let's see I don't struggle with let's
see let's focus on top comments only now
because I gotta wrap this up
um I think that's about it all right not
a lot of likes
let me see how long this video is
oh [ __ ] 11 minutes all right so I gotta
hurry this up it's seven hours enough my
day consists of gym swimming work study
side of the house so I mean again if you
feel great after seven hours minus the
coffee
uh then that's fine
um remember the only time you should
take coffee is if you don't need it I
repeat the only time you should say
coffee or caffeine is when you don't eat
it so when you don't need it you just
want that extra boost the extra boosting
Focus that extra dopamine action you
want a black adaptation just a little
bit more that's fine but you should not
take coffee if you need it if you need
caffeine and something is wrong
so yeah seven hours like I said earlier
you know if you feel great without the
caffeine then sure
um let's see uh but yeah after seven
hours I wake up yeah watch my video and
sleep again make sure you tired make
sure you the room is cold make sure you
eat a nice high carb meal a few hours
before sleep
um let's see next um and guys the reason
why
let me read this first
this is one of the things controversial
because some athletes I'm not able to
[ __ ] that is I've said that on TLT it's
difficulty getting one in 2016 anyway
but
um when me and my buddy got a level of
dragons yeah
um
oh but wait you stay as an athlete you
know what actually sorry I forgot
athletes fall into the category of the
three people that I think should get a
pass on TLT
um if it's a real athlete because
nowadays everyone's oh I'm an athlete
and it's like [ __ ] like recording
videos and doing backflips in your
backyard it's not making an athlete but
like I always say
[ __ ] everybody was on TLT except people
who who fall into the three categories
number one people who are sick right
people who just cannot
produce testosterone because of sickness
like a serious Sickness by the way I'm
not so [ __ ] cold I'm talking
about like AIDS cancer you know then I
see you riding away yeah inject all
those [ __ ] with testosterone
that could I don't care load them up
with steroids right because they can't
do anything number two
professional athletes right because if
you if you're in the NFL or the NBA or
whatever and you're not on some PDS you
[ __ ] you [ __ ] because you're gonna get
out competed and you won't be able to
feed your family
um especially if you're putting your
life on the line you know like football
NFL football and obviously number three
like I would say is military and defense
so like cops uh people on the front
lines yeah they should be on every
[ __ ] PD imaginable because one
they're under intense stress meaning
that's already crushing their tea levels
they can't sleep eight hours a day you
know you came here on the front line oh
let me get my hair out of sleep to boost
my testosterone
um they can't they don't have time I'm
like oh let me make sure I get my liver
and my antioxidants whatever yeah so if
you're an army man putting your life on
the line to for your nation or for
whatever
hey Jack those [ __ ] with everything
you could think about you know same
thing with cops you know it's the most
stressful job you know always high
cortisol
um life and death scenario yeah but if
you're not
in one of those three categories right
so if you if you're not in the ICU where
you cannot produce testosterone
naturally or you know let's say you have
like a tumor or your or you lost your
testicles
um if you're not um
a military man or cop on the front lines
and you're not a professional athlete
then you'll scumbag will happen on trt
I'm sorry you are because you just
picked the easy way out but that's just
my opinion that's just my opinion guys
you know
um who am I to judge right
and also remember it's your life do what
you want with it if you want to happen
to you if you're not in those three
categories and you want to hop on TLT
anyway then that's fine you're right let
me take it back let me not call you
scumbag because I can't judge you I
don't know what your life is like
what I hate though is when
people on trt lie about it or try to
give advice to natties that's who this
comebacks are people who want trt and
either lie about it
they call it natural or they try to give
advice to Naturals oh that makes me
insane
um but anyway
so next uh
all right let's just getting up to Pace
yeah yeah if you I mean it depends if
you got up to pee after a rep cycle I
guess you're fine but if you get up in
the middle of a REM cycle yeah you screw
29 stay on the seven yeah I mean that's
why
um that's why uh T levels that's another
reason why T levels are in the [ __ ]
gutter right
and there's a lot of comments on this
one the [ __ ]
I'm about to read all this
um Smeagol I see me go back as [ __ ]
um five hours at night
sleeping more than eight months not
responsibility not only just as a
[ __ ] excuse get the [ __ ] out of here
nope nope nope people love to use that
cop out oh I have responsibilities
there's 24 hours in a day if you sleep
for eight that still leaves you with 16.
out of those 16. what are you doing
what are you doing the gym what that's
an hour
work or school six to eight hours max
right that's nine you still have plenty
of time so I don't want to hear this
[ __ ] because I got more responsibilities
than 99.9 of you [ __ ] and I
still find a way to optimize my sleep
whenever I can obviously
right so don't use that as an excuse
right take care of your body take care
of your health because when your health
breaks down when your t-levels go to
[ __ ] and you won't even be able to
handle your responsibilities
okay but anyway I'm a dad again that's
an excuse I'm a dad too don't use that
um in fact if you're a dad that's
another reason why you should try to get
your eight hours of sleep because your
family needs you
all right if you got sleep apnea
definitely get that fixed uh four hours
oh this is crazy
all right let's keep going
wait I think I read this [ __ ] already
these numbers aside yeah yeah these
numbers are [ __ ] side
um all right that's uh
what's that sleep scientists have proven
big virus in sleeping classes I said
kiss my nuts bruh of course there's
gonna be various oh my God let me stop
let me stop I think he's probably trying
to trolling me
um
I'm a dumbass and all the benefits are
still messed up my rhythm
um and guys keep in mind we just want to
get mad these comments right like I'm
fine with disagreements as long as you
say something logical and you know straw
man me or you don't say the most obvious
[ __ ] right you finally disagree
but please don't make assumptions right
and don't say things that are obvious
oh this big versus State requirements
yes there's variance in everything
there's big variance in protein
requirements car requirements caloric
requirements
micronutrient requirements your point
I mean uh
anyway
um let's see what do you mean all right

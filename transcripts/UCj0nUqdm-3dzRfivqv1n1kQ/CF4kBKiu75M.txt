hey guys what's going on megan here so
another episode of top tier tuesday this
one we're gonna use the same
cheerleaders we use for top 10 protein
sources for muscle growth
but we're gonna twist it up this time
and do
top 10 protein sources for fat loss to
lose weight now obviously keep in mind
there's nothing magical about these
protein sources right food is food um so
the criteria we're gonna focus on is
one something that's gonna keep you full
right something that's gonna be slow to
digest because obviously if you're on a
caloric deficit or you're cutting
you want to focus on protein sources
that are going to keep you full for as
long as possible right you don't want to
eat something that's going to make you
hungry an hour later right yes obviously
you know you're still going to lose
weight if you're in a deficit but
the goal here is to make it as easy as
possible right so that's the criteria
we're using we need something that's
slow to digest
it's where you stay full as long as
possible that's going to make your cut
easier and number two
we need something that's also packed
with nutrients right because remember if
you restrict your calories
chances are you're going to run into
vitamin and mineral deficiencies because
obviously you're not eating as much
especially when you go very low so let's
say
2 000 calories or less some of you guys
are even cutting on like 1800 calories
it's gonna be very very hard for you
guys to get all your vitamins and
minerals and obviously multivitamins are
trash so
the key is to be in a deficit while at
the same time maximizing the amount of
bioavailable
vitamins and minerals that you can get
from these foods all right so let's get
started chicken
believe it or not as popular as it is
i'm gonna put in okay and the reason i'm
putting out okay is because one it
digests very [ __ ] fast right if you
eat chicken it's to be out of your
stomach within an hour or two usually
two hours depending on how much fat is
on it right that's not enough to stay
full and on top of that
it's not as dense
as other sauces when it comes to
vitamins and minerals right so as hyped
up as chicken is yeah it tastes great
but it won't be at the top of my list uh
if i'm helping someone lose weight
or if i'm designing a meal plan for
fallows in general next milk obviously
i'm going to put milk at pure garbage
and it's going to shock a lot of you
guys because muck is one of my top
protein sources but remember this is not
for muscle growth this is for fat loss
this is being in a caloric deficit this
is for
limiting your appetite
milk digests way too fast right
obviously drinking milk
that's just going to be out of your
system within an hour to an hour and a
half
i mean out of your stomach so that's not
a good protein source to stay full
the nutrients are there but once again
you're gonna be hungry way too soon uh
next shrimp again i'm also gonna put
shrimp down here at bad because no one
eats shrimp and says oh i'm full for the
next four hours right
yes the digestion time is a bit longer
but you're gonna be hungry within two
hours right it's not something that's
gonna it's not very satiating
and it's also very low in nutrients
relative to the other items on the list
right keep in mind all these things have
nutrients but relative to the other
items on the list then at the top
beans i'm gonna put beans that [ __ ]
amazing for cutting and i'll tell you
what one obviously it's going to take a
while to digest
due to the fiber content
two you're getting your nutrients you're
getting a [ __ ] ton of nutrients and your
fiber of course
and three beans are very [ __ ]
balanced when they go when it comes to
macros you're getting protein you're
getting carbs you're getting fiber
very hard to beat that um when you're on
a correct deficit next in the [ __ ]
amazing category cottage cheese once
again high in protein so that's gonna be
very satiating but two it takes a very
long time to digest inside but the fact
that it has casein so so that's gonna be
in your digestive tract longer
and that's gonna help keep you full uh
the only thing is it's not very very
very high in nutrient density next eggs
again i wanna put eggs out okay
um they're not going to go higher on the
list for two main reasons one
eggs actually die just pretty [ __ ]
fast right especially if you're doing
egg whites now if you're using egg yolks
you know if you're eating the yolk with
the egg whites then digestion is going
to be a little longer but not as much
now it's very very high in nutrient
density right so i was gonna put in a
[ __ ] amazing um but once again
for the amount of calories you're
getting actually just not sound [ __ ]
enough right you're gonna be ready to go
in about two to three hours right in
fact the whole egg uh can take sometimes
just an hour to digest uh depending on
what else is in your stomach next whey
protein again something that was at the
top of the list when we were doing uh
the previous video this one is gonna be
in pure garbage once again simply
because
it digests way too fast right about an
hour and a half and this thing is done
you're gonna be hungry again right
so
not good enough when you're looking for
something to keep you full and obviously
the nutrient density is not as high as
the other items here next salmon now i'm
gonna put salmon here right at the top
of okay i wanted to put in a [ __ ]
amazing simply because it is one of the
highest
highest nutrient dense
protein sources out there so full of
nutrients i mean just four ounces of
salmon is going to give you vitamin d
your omega-3s for the day your b
vitamins your selenium potassium zinc
phosphorus you name it right very very
high nutrient density um the only thing
is you're gonna be hungry
within two hours probably an hour and a
half for some people right uh that's the
only issue i have with fish right that's
just way too fast unless you eat it with
a ton of fiber to try to slow down
digestion but once again we're referring
to protein only not protein combined
with fiber and fat and stuff like that
next we have pork believe it or not
i'm about to not calorie right i mean
this thing will stain your stomach for
at least four to five hours right now
again depending on who you are some
people are gonna say that's not a good
thing blah blah blah but remember if
you're in the correct deficit you're
trying to stay full right one of the
number one reasons why people break the
diet simply because they're hungry so
you want something that's gonna keep you
full and
pork is gonna stay in your stomach for
at least four to five hours right
depending on the cut of course right so
that's going to keep you full for a long
time especially if you eat that for
breakfast which is obviously uh
a very unusual breakfast choice but
trust me when you're in a caloric
deficit you want to eat something
filling early in the day as early as
possible to try to keep hunger at bay
and pork is definitely up there
plus once again very high nutrient
density you're getting all your b
vitamins you're getting your zinc you're
getting your iron some selenium so even
though it's a bit high in calories again
depending on the cut if you take
something lean and you don't have to
worry about the
uh the high fat content but um you're
getting a lot of bang for your buck and
last but not least steak right just
[ __ ] meat red meat
at the very top of this list if you're
trying to go on the caloric deficit so
you want something that's going to keep
you full steak is up there just like
pork is going to be in your stomach for
at least four and a half hours and
that's at least right
if you're eating something else with
that then it's gonna be in your stomach
even longer so that's gonna keep you
full uh no one eats 10 ounces of steak
in the morning and says oh i'm hungry
two hours later you know that i mean
like unless you have a monster hepatite
that's probably not going to be the case
so it's going to keep you full
and two the nutrient density is off the
charts up there with salmon right red
meat needs no introduction when it comes
to nutrient density uh in protein
sources and if eating beef liver oh my
god that's even more nutrients but not
to mention you're also getting creatine
you know a ton of creatine relative to
the other sources you're getting your
iron you're getting your zinc
you're getting your b vitamins you're
getting creatine you're getting
carnitine i mean come on you cannot go
wrong with steak and it's going to keep
you
full for most of the day
and as far as calories go yeah it's very
high in fat but once again you can try
to make it fit your macros
or you could just take a very lean cut
but keep in mind that yes even though
it's high in calories
it's going to keep you full for so long
that
you might still be in a caloric deficit
right because you're not going to
overeat right so it's not all about just
oh this thing is high in calories all
this thing is low in calories right
something can be low in calories
but if you're going to keep eating all
day long eventually that might put you
in a surplus
all right so keep things in context but
anyway guys that's the list
keep in mind this is for creating a
caloric deficit as efficiently as
possible right
while getting a lot of vitamins and
minerals at the same time you can create
a deficit with any of these foods right
it's just a matter of efficiency and
effectiveness right by the way guys hope

anybody who has a nurse to call
toughness and and the desire to seek
power and Status anybody that has a
nurse to call that toxic should [ __ ] off
you guys are so a bunch of hypocrites
hey guys what's going on Megan here all
right I had to come back out of
hibernation early because of something
that blew my mind
um but anyway this is what Society
thinks is toxic right look at this
picture here
being tough being stored being strong
being bold being dominant Society caused
that toxic masculinity right meanwhile
the opposite of those traits right being
soft emotional weak faithful submissive
Society sees that is a good thing
now
prior to this when I when I heard the
term toxic masculinity believe it or not
I actually thought that that meant
somebody who's you know engaging in
sexual assault sexual harassment
bullying you know that's what I thought
that meant when people said toxic
masculinity which is why you know I
never paid in any mind because I was
like yeah that's definitely toxic
but you would be surprised at what the
actual official definition of toxic
masculinity is let me show you guys but
before I start here's a disclaimer again
I do not promote in fact I'm vehemently
against any form of sexual assault
domestic violence bullying massage
generation racism any form of hate
towards any innocent personal group I'm
gonna explain my innocent to the
contrary I believe that all men should
strive to be heroes and selflessly
sacrifice themselves for the good of
Mankind through acts of service and
bravery that's what team Duty offers all
about right dominant discipline
Direction
um I got a pretty disclaimer out there
because nowadays you guys already know
the cancer culture likes to straw menu
so they can cancel you right so that's
straw man what you're really trying to
say and then it gives them a reason to
try to cancel you they're like all these
guys promoting this these guys put money
there so let's get this claimer out the
way
now here's the part that blew my mind
and I was like man I gotta I gotta come
out I gotta come out of hibernation
um if you go online and you type toxic
definition of I mean official definition
of toxic masculinity this is what pops
up read this guys a cultural concept of
Manliness so far so good that glorifies
stoicism
um how's that toxic strength
let that sink in strength is under toxic
masculinity virility
so your ability to obviously clap Chase
and pass on your genes right being a
photo man
um dominance
um and again that is socially
maladaptive or harmful to mental health
that is the most
hypocritical definition
I've ever seen I could not believe this
if you don't believe me online and type
official definition of toxic masculinity
because what we're not going to do is
like before I make a video I want to
make sure that I'm not strong man in my
opposition right so I looked up a
different definition
this one was on some website called very
well mine or some [ __ ] like that I just
I just clicked on what pops up first
right because when most people are
searching this is what pops up and I put
a toxic masculinity he's in a Barbie
anyway skip all that look they put
some researchers have come to agree that
toxic masculinity which would be a bad
thing right has three core components
one toughness let that sink in for a
minute toughness is seen as being
toxically masculine
this is the notion that men should be
physically strong emotionally callous
and behaviorally aggressive
uh anti-family femininity
this involves the idea that man should
reject anything that's considered to be
feminine so to show an emotion or
accepting help
um now again they're mixing a bunch of
stuff here keep in mind guys men have
evolved to compliment women there's a
reason why we different in women is
because what's the point of a man if
you're not somehow different to females
right that's literally why we evolved
that's why we have Y chromosomes
right we're supposed to compliment women
you can't compliment somebody if you
exactly like them that makes no [ __ ]
sense but anyway uh and power this is
the assumption that men must work
towards obtaining power and Status so
they can get the respect of others so
they're saying that this is bad the
desire to to become powerful the desire
to uh amass well for status they're
pretty much saying that this is a bad
thing
and let me show you why this is the most
hypocritical thing ever it is so wrong
and it's causing more damage more harm
than good right so they're pretty much
saying that this guy here is bad
he has toxic masculinity but this guy
here is good
that's what society's you know actually
wants you to believe
because let's be honest the guys who are
out there defending us the guys that are
out there securing our borders the guys
who are out there making sure that your
your wives your daughters your sisters
are not being evaded by some foreign
country the guys that are making sure
that the moment any foreign power tries
to step foot on American soil or
whatever Nation you're in
right the guys will make it so that we
can actually sleep at night
you bet you better believe that they're
not solved emotional weak faithful and
submissive
right else that Never Would Have Made It
Up the ranks
these are the guys that we owe our
freedom to these are the guys that we
all you know believe it or not our
safety our well-being
these are the guys that nobody talks
about
because you guys know you guys know I'm
a history nerd I study history so much
for the last what 18 plus years
and one thing history teaches us is that
you cannot afford to be weak you cannot
you could be the nicest person on Earth
but you cannot afford to be weak because
the guy on the other side is more than
willing to cross over your territory and
take everything that you hold there this
has happened Time and Time and Time
Again throughout history you could have
a nice peaceful Society but if you don't
have strong men
dominant man defending that Society
you get your cheeks clapped by the
conquerors right
the enemy comes and then they take all
your [ __ ] and you're not going to have
time at the last minute to be all right
all right let's quickly transform all of
our soft men into monsters no there
better be Monsters by the time the enemy
comes but anyway let's keep going
right these are the this is what Society
one should be like a Smiggle
[ __ ] right soft emotional weak
faithful submissive
but somehow this is frowned upon
make it make sense guys
right
but anyway let me show you guys 10
reasons why this is so [ __ ]
number one
boobies you see a lot of you guys out
there a lot of the guys that support you
know the idea that men should be weak
and we shouldn't be tough and we
shouldn't you know we should show our
emotions a lot of your [ __ ]
were never bullied see I was bullied
when I was a kid right guys remember I
was an immigrant right I came in when I
was 11 years old I was bullied like a
[ __ ] in fact the reason why I'm
as tough as I am now is because I was
bullied and I decided to stand up for
myself become stronger look my bullying
their eye and shut them down see boys
have to deal with bullies and the
teacher is not going to save us
right our parents are not going to save
us I actually had to go home to an
abusive mother so that was even worse
the biggest building in my life was
actually my mother but I said that's a
different video right most boys out
there
most men out there we know what it's
like to grow up and have a bully in your
neighborhood
it is frightening you you you feel
worthless you feel powerless right and
the only way I personally broke out of
that
was about toughening up
right boys have to deal with bodies
before we become men
right and like I said the teacher
doesn't save us our parents don't save
us the principle doesn't save us
right if you go and tell the teacher hey
this kid is bullying me I don't give a
[ __ ] they'll just like slap their you
know give the bully slap on the wrist
and then you still got to deal with them
okay two men know what I'm talking about
in fact almost every tough man that I
know was bullied at some point and it is
that experience that actually turned
them into a [ __ ] Alpha is when he
said no more never again
right so you won't talk about how
toughness is a Bad Thing stoicism is a
Bad Thing kiss my ass right because you
guys weren't there when we had to
toughen up in fact it's toxic
masculinity that saves Us in fact I'm
gonna make a video soon called toxic
masculinity save my life
because if it wasn't for the idea if it
wasn't for the belief that I had to be
tough that I had to be strong I would
have probably come to Suicide a long
time ago
right
boys have to deal with bullies if you
overcome bullies
by by becoming mentally tough
by standing up to them by becoming
strong
right
I don't know how to bully guys I grew up
in the inner cities
and there was bullies everywhere on
every block
right we couldn't even go to the
playground
right I couldn't go to the playground
without running into bullies
right and I was bullied from the time I
was 11 all the way until I was about 13
13 14 is when I finally decided to stand
up to my bully and he never [ __ ] with
me ever again right think about it for a
second the one time when I finally
decided to stand up to my bully and say
you know what I'm trying to go on back
home right no one is helping me I'm
gonna put this into my own hands and I
was terrified when I did that when I
stood up to my bully I was actually
[ __ ] terrified because I thought I
was going to lose because my booties are
never alone they're usually in the group
but I was like you know what I'm so sick
and tired of of of losing this thing I'm
gonna stand up and fight
and believe it or not that's when the
bully finally respected me because in
his mind he actually thought I'm going
to fight believe it or not I actually
didn't want to fight but I put on that
confidence I was like [ __ ] it
I'd rather go down and get my ass
whooped then run away
and it's a long story I can make a video
about that you know he tried to jump me
but it didn't work and then after a
while people came to my defense blah
blah blah and since then when he would
see me he would just not say what up
you know so don't tell don't tell men
that they have to be oh they have to be
emotional you know they have to cry and
they have to show their emotions and and
they have to be soft kiss my ass toxic
masculinity saved my life right so
telling men that day that it's okay to
be soft it's okay to cry it's okay to to
to to be weak you shouldn't be strong
you shouldn't seek power you are setting
them up for failure because it doesn't
matter I don't care how good your
intentions are they still have to deal
with things like they still have to deal
with bullies they still have to deal
with the fact that the world is not
peaceful the world is not safe
right and the world will eat you alive
if you are weak Only the Strong Survive
I know you guys want us to be in a
utopian world where yeah you know no no
we can't as men we cannot afford to be
weak we can't we just can't because
nobody comes to our rescue
like I had to learn years ago
the second reason why
toxic masculinity is needed again using
your definition of toxic masculinity
right people saying that toxic
masculinity means you tough and you
don't show whatever when it's a criminal
at your door who do you call you call
the police
is the police made up of feminine soft
weak men or is the police force made of
dominant strong powerful men
who are ready to vaporize this fool
which one is it see make up your mind
right and I'm talking to the people who
are against that who against masculinity
because let's be honest they say they're
against toxic masculinity but in
definition they're really against
masculinity period
you know one as a criminal at your
doorstep what do you call do you call
your pastor
you call your mother
do you call the nurse no you call the
police and the police doesn't send you a
pastor then I'll send you a manager a
place no they send you Violent Men
they send you men
who are ready to put this guy behind
bars right
and obviously over 80 percent of the
police force are men there's a reason
for that may not bigger stronger faster
duh you know obviously and also men are
willing to take more risks right I mean
one time what was this um I was in the
Starbucks and a crazy guy walked in
right I'm asking if I was in Starbucks
way but a crazy guy walked in I was a
homeless guy but he you know he was not
okay in the head he walked in and I was
the only guy in the sub box I was
sitting down talking to a friend
um oh [ __ ] I gave it away but anyway I
was sitting down talking to friend and
um uh I was the only guy in there
it was only about like I think three
four other women you know
and the guy walks in and he's just
tripping balls right he's no homeless
guy he's crazy he's talking to himself
whatever and at that moment I realized
holy [ __ ] if he pulls out a knife it
starts stabbing people I'm gonna have to
get up put my life at risk and we train
them I have to
I have no other choice
right and I don't mind I don't mind I
remember I believe men should be heroes
right and I imagine if I decided not to
if I was like you know what if he
decides to attack everybody I'm just
gonna scream and run like everybody else
the video would have went live and they
would have been oh my God it was a guy
in there he didn't do anything the same
people who say that we should be solved
and submissive and weak whatever uh the
same ones or to drive me through the
door they said oh my God breaking news a
homeless crazy son of a [ __ ] walked
into Starbucks started putting out his
knife or his penis or whatever and said
stabbing everybody there was a man in
there he didn't do anything he screamed
just like all the other girls
yeah we have to deal with this
with the expected to be uh uh you know
to show our toxic masculinity only when
it benefits others
what kind of hypocrisy is this
you can't have it both ways either you
want us to be strong dominant powerful
protective or you want us to be weak you
can't it's not an on and off switch
right and of course I was going to body
that guy I was going to fold the [ __ ]
out of him anyway you know if he if he
tried anything I was going to fold them
because of my own values not because
it's expected of me that's the point I'm
trying to make guys
the reason why you [ __ ] are
safe is because men strong masculine men
are keeping the bad guys away as corny
as that sounds
you enjoy it's funny I I see people
going on on news networks they're
talking about all masculinity toxic
masculinity so bad yet the person the
woman was saying now the guy who was
saying that you're driving through a
street free of criminals
you got to that station New Station
whatever without having to worry about
your safety of your life why because
toxic masculine men
keep you safe sort of the hypocrisy
let's keep going
next
who protects us from Invaders once again
if you study history you know that the
history of mankind is the history of
Conquest the history of War tribes got
conquered one after the other
once The Barbarians come in they kill
all the men or they enslave the men they
rape the women they raped the daughters
regardless of age they kill everybody
they enslave you
Vincent repeat there's really history in
a nutshell every tribe had to go through
that every nation is to go through that
right
the reason why we don't have to deal
about this today once again is because
men who are powerful who are strong
protect us right over 90 percent
of the elite military amen
these are guys that keep us safe
and what are they are they feminine or
are they masculine you tell me
who would you want to protect you you
see uh it's funny it's funny I always
joke around my friends and I say
Society complains about toxic
masculinity until their Barbarians at
the gate I repeat Society complains
about toxic masculinity until there are
barbarians at the gate
because I guarantee you if we become
invaded by some random country or
whatever all these guys were like that
were like oh men should be soaked men
should be weakness should be emotional
or whatever
what's going on save us [ __ ] you
you know
our borders are safe because of
masculine men
and history does not lie if you are not
strong enough to protect your borders
you were conquered you were enslaved
your mother your daughter your sisters
were raped in front of your very eyes
so the reason you are safe today the
reason you could go on YouTube today or
on the news and say that men shouldn't
be too masculine is because masculine
men made the world safe
hypocrite sons of [ __ ]
next starvation you might think well
what does toxic masculinity what does
masculinity have to do with starvation
guys the reason we have enough food to
eat believe it or not is because men are
not afraid to be masculine
fishing and hunting is one of the most
dangerous professions in the world look
it up
it is extremely dangerous
and sure enough it appeals to masculine
men over 90 percent of people in fishing
hunting amen
woman on one in fact those professions
are begging for women to come in because
they want to increase diversity women
are like nope
in fact women are overrepresented in uh
the safest jobs kindergarten teach you
kindergarten teacher a dentist dental
assistant whatever
you know
nutrition
and that's not a knock on women you know
they're playing to their strengths
they're very impassionate they have a
lot of empathy they're they're gentle
they're good at analyzing they're good
at uh you know
um putting themselves in other people's
shoes all the qualities that are that
are associated with being a a feminine
person women I'm making it you know
making the best out of it which is good
it's a biology yes there's some Society
uh there's some cultural inputs but it's
mainly rooted in biology but anyway I
digress
over 90 of people who work in fishing
hunting are men and it's one of the most
dangerous jobs in the world they go
there knowing that they have a high
chance of dying but they do it anyway
because they have a sense of Duty they
have a sense of responsibility they have
a sense of Honor they bold the
courageous testosterone
he's making him do this right
agriculture over 80 percent of farmers
agricultures are men
and it's a very hard job obviously
recently you know we uh because of the
Industrial Revolution it's not as hard
as it used to be years ago but it's
still hard nonetheless
right and it was even harder before the
Industrial Revolution
but men woke up rolled up their sleeves
went to work and made sure that
you sons of [ __ ] have enough food on
your table
these are not jobs that most people want
to do unless they have a very high
degree of quote-unquote toxic
masculinity next
one of the number one thing that
protects us from disease it's not the
doctor it's not the nurse no it's the
people who take care of waste your
garbage collector the people who work in
underground sewers
you go to Any Nation throughout history
where they didn't have a
[Music]
you know well-functioning sewage system
or whatever disease was rampant
one of the number one ways
to have a healthy Society is to have men
to have actually to have people who are
willing to do the Dirty Work
and guess what over 90 percent it's
actually way higher than 90 but again
over 90 of people who work in these
fields a man are you surprised most
women are like hell to the no I don't
want this job
and they try to get women there once
again look at them to try to get women
there
women are like nope no thank you but
somebody has to do the job right this is
a guy in India here
this is in the western world and look
who wants to work in a sewer who wants
to work there
who wants to work there
the reason why they go is because they
have a sense of Duty
and they're like somebody has to do it
also they're trying to move up apart and
I'm not going to bring up you know uh
educational attainment and all that you
know that's the places role but really
men are really men are ready to pick up
jobs that nobody wants to do to keep
Society going
whether they do it for selfish reasons
whether they do it you know Mississippi
doesn't matter they're the ones out
there keeping us safe and healthy
and again this is not a knock on women
by the way this is not a knock on women
women have their own strengths and they
play to those streams like I said you
know to prove to you that I'm not
against women all of these men who are
doing all these wonderful drivers and
keeping us going well a hundred percent
of those men were birthed by Hope by
women so I give women their credit
I just don't like it when men get thrown
under the buses if they're not
contributing to society
you know
get rid of the garbage collectors get
rid of the super workers get rid of all
the plumbers all the guys who help you
know uh with sanitation and all that and
in no time there'll be an epidemic
but yet they're unsung heroes
and the Very coverage that brings them
into the sewers is not called toxic
no pun intended
next
the dangers of nature toxic masculinity
protects us from nature
right over 90 of people who provide you
electricity who do construction or
loggers even firefighters and Men once
again are you surprised that over 90
percent of firefighters are men over 90
of construction workers are men over 90
percent of loggers are men
right people who work on power lines
okay look it up if you don't believe me
the most dangerous jobs again fulfilled
by men and we think that you think this
guy this little right here look dangling
in the [ __ ] Sky such a dangerous
[ __ ] job not only he can fall he can
get electrocuted whatever
what pushes them to these jobs if it's
not that [ __ ] testosterone
if it's not the masculinity
you think you could do these jobs and be
emotional and weak
no
right but yet we enjoy the safety that
these guys provide we enjoy the the you
know the world that they built for us
but we're going to point fingers to say
oh you guys are toxic screw you right
anybody who has a nurse should call
toughness and and the desire to seek
power and Status anybody that has a
nurse to call that toxic should [ __ ] off
you guys are so a bunch of hypocrites
next protection from animals see people
forget that the world is a dangerous
place there are wild animals out there
right if you're walking you know you
know down the street and the [ __ ]
bear comes out of nowhere throughout the
evolutionary pass right you were [ __ ]
we forget that it was not cities and
buildings everywhere there were animals
and wild animals everywhere
but man built the world man made the
world safe man Drew boundaries
back then I had to risk their lives to
save the tribe if a bear broken didn't
write it back in those days right
because we were
little hunter-gatherers for most of our
existence right over 99 like this stuff
you know my history notes I love going
back to history
right and we're a homo sapiens for over
300 000 years
when a lion broke into the camp or a
bear or whatever
who do you think came forward and fought
off the wild animal you think we sent
the women up up front
the black men women
no the man came forward risked their
lives in fact that's what when you look
at neanderthals and when we dig up bones
usually demand that horrible deaths
did that hunting with a dog protecting
or they died fighting other men whatever
so the reason why I would have a bunch
of wild animals running around in fact
right now as you're watching this video
if you if you look out the window you
see a bunch of lines loose or a bunch of
bears loose I don't know maybe they Buck
out of a zoo or some [ __ ] whatever who
are we gonna send
to put him down or capture them or
whatever
you tell me a bunch of women are a bunch
of men and again it's another it's not
an attack on women
I'm just bringing out the facts
and keep in mind we have guns in that we
have tranquilizers imagine if we didn't
have guns that would have tranquilizers
whatever and you had to get up close and
personal who would we send
we'll send men and I'm perfectly fine
with that because man I actually
expandable man I'll explain what man
can't have babies right one man can we
populate like a whole [ __ ] town if
not the whole world but one woman one
woman can't so I get what men are
expendable
but we Embrace that we accept that and
we sacrifice ourselves for the
betterment of society
can we at least get some [ __ ] respect
right I'm in my apartment now if a bear
breaks in
Who's Gonna Go My Girlfriend my daughter
or me
in order for me to face
a situation where I know there's a 99
Choice I'm gonna get my [ __ ] snapped up
I need to have some degree of confidence
toughness I need to stay calm
I need to be stored and I'm being told
that that's actually bad
next income we don't want to make money
right
problem is we live in a very competitive
world where for every dollar you want
somebody else wants the exact same
dollar
so we have to be competitive we gotta
have high testosterone we got to be
industrious we got to be conscientious
right
the man at the top of the world you know
had to work extremely hard to get there
and for us to even come close to a
quarter of their wealth a percentage of
their wealth we also have to work our
asses off
that requires a degree of toughness a
degree of ambition
testosterone
the hormone that motivates us to become
better and to fight for status
if we don't use that
we stay poor but we're being told that
it's a bad thing right we shouldn't be
ambitious we shouldn't strive for the
top right it's funny everybody wants
money
but nobody wants to do the work that it
takes to get that money
so why are we telling men that it should
be they shouldn't be ambitious but at
the same time if the guy's not ambitious
and he doesn't make money because he
doesn't want to compete then we're going
to mock him for being broke right oh
you're a broke [ __ ] haha you broke
you're broke
right
make up your mind
don't tell men that it shouldn't be
ambitious but at the same time you know
all the benefits that are awarded to men
who are actually ambitious and became
top earners Ambitions should never be a
bad thing
next
women sexual selection
the reason why men are masculine
the single number one reason why men are
masculine meaning they are strong
they're ambitious right
they're courageous is because those are
the ones that women picked those are the
ones that your whole ass great great
great great grandmother picked when
women are given a choice in every
culture you look at they always speak
the most competent males this is well
known I'm from Africa you see it in
Africa you see it in Asia you sit in
Europe
and it has not changed women take the
man at the top it doesn't matter what
the culture is
it doesn't matter what the job is it
could be I worked so many jobs when I
was young so many jobs and it was the
same thing when I worked at Walmart
Kroger I worked as a teaching assistant
I walked as a tutor I worked so many
jobs and it was the same pattern they
always predict whatever that job was
whatever that profession or whatever
that the store was the women always went
for the guy to stop the supervisor they
went for the guy that uh you know that
was just the most competent meal
is that a coincidence no it's ingrained
into their brain
and I would imagine if you explaining
why women are so picky you can watch
that video
right and I also made a video about you
know it's called your ancestor was the
alpha male and I explained why being in
Africa was actually a good thing and I
gave the true definition of Rapha which
is not a bully obviously but simply the
most valuable person in the group
remember that study right that found
that 8 000 years ago
one man reproduced for every 17 women
meaning the vast majority of men did not
pass on their genes
and the one man that passed on his jeans
for every 17 women who do you think it
was you think he was the softest guy
right who just sat there and and clapped
all the girls cheeks no
he had something
the same pattern that we see today
he was valuable he was good at something
right women are hypergamous we all know
that they picked the man at the top
so by telling the guy out there that he
shouldn't be ambitious he shouldn't be
competent he shouldn't be strong
whatever you pretty much telling him
that he shouldn't pass on his genes
because the statistics don't lie
women have a minimum income threshold
for the guys that they marry and they
you could be the most handsome guy in
the world you could be the most
emotional guy in the world if you make
five thousand dollars a year
huge chance
that you're not gonna get the girl of
your dreams
and that's a fact
right women
are the reason why men are masculine and
I don't blame them I don't blame them
because the world is a dangerous place
right throughout our evolutionary past
think about it what's that video I made
about you know what women are picky the
world is so dangerous for women
and if you put yourself in a female
shoes
you get your period every month cramping
full of pain once you black man you got
to go through nine months of pregnancy
you know it hinders your ability to to
to hunt it handles your ability to to
get food on top of that you need more
calories because you're pregnant a whole
human a whole [ __ ] growing in your
belly right and when the baby's born
he's louder than a [ __ ] he's
always crying and attracting predators
and prey right you can't leave them to
go hunt as a female because again the
moment you leave them
an ego is going to snap his [ __ ] up or
whatever right
because of that women evolved to have a
strong man by the side so that the guy
can provide for them while they're
pregnant so the guy can protect them
from other men other Predators it's
common sense it's common sense
and that's right to this day women are
still programmed to pick strong
competent men
and the final reason
why man should be masculine
depression guys I've fought with
depression ever since I was every second
[ __ ] remember right and I told you
why before right I I had to do I had a
mother that wouldn't even wish on my
worst enemy
right grew up without my father in the
home
I grew up with an extremely abusive
mother and I've tried to forgive her so
many times by Jesus she would not stop I
mean again I could make a whole
different video about that but so
my father in the home
abusive mother bullies all around you at
home you can't find police outside you
can't find peace well what's the result
of that
chronic depression I am everything I am
today as tough as Nails because
I had to decide to become a man
I have no one to show me
I need to to lead me into manhood I
didn't have a right of passage pain was
my teacher drama was my teacher
and every time I struggled with
depression
it's something that would never go away
obviously
right when you ever [ __ ] up childhood
and your mom is literally the worst
person in your life you're never heal
you never [ __ ] heal
right because even my friends even some
of the worst guys out there at least
they had a loving mother that was there
for them which me was the opposite I I
literally spent years of my life trying
to undo that mental damage but you wanna
know what kept me going
when I wanted to just give up and make a
ton of excuses as to why I should I
should just
I should just stop what kept me going
was the ideas of masculinity
reading about the heroes of old reading
about you know that that's why I love
reading about cultures you know that's
why I read the Bible the Quran I read
you know um uh myths I read uh
mythologies you know wherever I found
Heroes
even Dragon Ball Z as a kid you know
Comics whatever I always looked towards
I always looked at the dominant male
that overcame adversity and that's what
kept me going
your therapist couldn't help me the
doctors couldn't help me
I just kept telling myself trying to man
up man up man up [ __ ] A lot of people
haven't know my my past because I rarely
talk about it
why because I don't want to give people
excuses I don't want to sound like I'm
giving an excuse
right but one of the best kills and
again I can only speak for myself I'm
not saying don't go GitHub if you're
depressed go get all the help you want I
don't want to get canceled
but what saved me personally was the
ideals of manhood
every time I wanted to complain about my
[ __ ] up childhood I always remember
Jonathan somebody had it worse and made
it Jonathan the word was so much worse
back then history taught me that wow
people actually had it bad
you can't overcome this
man up man up man up
and that's how I was able to survive
that's how I was able to accomplish so
many things even though all the odds
were against me because I was so myself
Jonathan somebody had it worse
and even if you were the one that had it
the worst you're a man you have a duty
become responsible become strong
every time I felt depression creeping up
on me
what saves me is the belief that men
should be tough it's literally that
simple
I'm not saying that you know you
shouldn't get help or none of that no by
any means get help in fact maybe I would
have turned out better if I would have
kept she came up but for my personal
experience that's what allowed me to
survive
is the belief that I should be strong
that I have a duty
and that I should overcome everything
that stone my way if I had grown up in
this [ __ ] ass generation that says that
oh you should cry you should you should
it's okay don't be tough oh my God
oh my God I would have jumped off a
bridge a long time ago because God I
went through so much [ __ ]
so again these are 10 reasons why I
believe that men
should hold on to the masculinity if
that's the way you guys want to Define
toxic masculinity
right let's go back
right if you want to Define toxic
masculinity as being tough and and being
powerful and and not and you know
not being emotional whatever oh I want
all of that toxic masculinity then
because as men there are so many times
we want to quit and what keeps us going
is because
we have that subconscious oath to our
masculinity we're like no
no
keep going keep fighting the only thing
man whether he was writing you love
Superman and Batman and Spider-Man and
Iron Man why do you think we love those
those fictional Heroes
you know
why do you think we're inspired about by
these movies and when we hear about you
know uh all these historic Achilles
Leonidas all the Hercules
it's in our DNA because our fathers our
ancestors had to be badass our male
ancestors had to be badass for them to
pass on their genes and for them to
survive
in this chaotic world
and now that they've conquered the
obstacles now you want to tell us to be
soft and weak suck my dick right anyway
guys
I'm sorry that this is the way I had to
come out of hibernation but man I had to
talk about this topic it it burned me to
the core because I told you the whole
time I thought you know toxic masculine
you just meant you know the bad things
like you know rape sexual harassment
bullying all that stuff
I had no idea that they had the nerves
to call these straight tear toxic
right but anyway guys again hope this
video helps comment your opinion below
join the Discord
join Reddit you know and remember team
3D Alpha dominance discipline Direction
that's what I believe in I believe men
should be dominant right which means
strong
competent
I believe there should be experts at
what they do
I believe man should be disciplined
meaning they should have honor they
should have courage
they should adhere to their values and
rules as long as it doesn't obviously
hurt others
they should have daily routines that
make them better every day they should
be disciplined pretty much right and I
wish I believe in direction that man
should be ambitious men should have you
know a vision
obviously a noble vision
try to change the world try to heal
people's pains that's what I believe in
dominance discipline Direction and
somehow
we live in a world where that's
considered a bad thing

hey guys what's going on megan here good
to be back as usual so let's take a
quick look at this study so you have
three groups of guys
that are separated between the lower
body group meaning they're only trained
low body
the upper body group and the full body
group right
three times a week for eight weeks and
the goal of the study was to see
which method of training would drop my
stand the most
so once again the lower body group only
trained legs the upper body group
only upper body three times a week of
course and a full body group train
everything
and as you can see unsurprisingly the
full body group
had the biggest by far the biggest drop
in myostatin
the lower body group dropped my stand to
an extent uh
obviously lowered an upper body group
but as you can see
it's night and day when you compare both
results
to the upper and lower body groups and
obviously they also had the biggest
increase
in father sat and which was obviously
the number one milestone blocker
and the results speak for themselves
when it comes to changing skeletal
muscle mass
the full body group built significantly
more muscle
and that also lost significantly more
fat as you can see
down here in the lower right corner but
anyway this is another episode of my
statin monday you guys
seem to enjoy these episodes but we just
talk about random things related to
myostatin which is obviously the most
important molecule
when it comes to muscle mass whether you
naughty or enhanced it is the most
important gene you want to constantly
down regulate if your goal is to
maximize muscle growth and fat loss as
well because obviously
the lower your my style levels the
leaner you'll be now for those who need
to refresh on my statin by the way you
can escape this part of the video if
you're already familiar with this
but for this we need a refresher it's
just a protein that your body produces i
received from a gene
and it has four main functions in the
body the first one is obviously stops
protein synthesis
it increases protein breakdown it lowers
satellite cell activation
and it makes you insulin resistant as
[ __ ] which obviously makes you skinny
fat and makes it harder for you to lose
fat
and phylostatin is obviously the other
protein that your body makes that
neutralizes the effects of myostatin so
the more microstatin you have the worse
you're gonna look the less muscle and
you have
obviously from lowering it on a daily
basis the easier it is going to be for
you to put on muscle and to lose fat the
same goes for phylostatin
vice versa the more phytostatin you have
the easier it is to build muscle
easier it is to burn fat the less
phallic style you produce
and again obviously all these things can
be manipulated to diet and exercise
and here are some visual examples of
what i mentioned earlier as you can see
here the reason why astronauts lose
muscle when i go in space is because my
stand goes through the roof same thing
with hiv or cancer patients the reason
why the muscles with their weight is
because
when you have hiv in certain forms of
cancer your myostatin levels go through
the roof your body starts to really
increase the activity of this gene same
thing for when you put your leg in a
cast or when you're in a wheelchair for
a long time
or you're not very active the reason why
you experience uh such a significant
loss in muscle mass is because
inactivity increases myostatin and as
you can see in these examples here these
are mice that were genetically modified
to overproduce
satin and under produce uh if i
completely lack my side and as you can
see look at the difference between the
mouse at the top which is a regular
mouse
and the mouse at the bottom which was
engineered to have
the double [ __ ] combo high five stat
and low mars status
night and day there goes the lag
comparison
here's another comparison side by side
here's the famous monkey that was
injected with phyllis stein this is his
leg
and look at what happened after just a
few weeks of injecting phylostatin
into his quads and last but not least
here's the boy i made a video about a
while back
he was lucky enough to have a master and
deficiency he's only about 10 years old
and look at him compared to an irish kid
his age
insane development look at his traps
look at his abs
look at his calf muscles his rhomboids
and if you look at the world of
professional bodybuilders that's really
all steroids do the reason why they look
so cartoonish
is mainly because steroids neutralize
the effects of myostatin
mainly by increasing phylostatin
increasing igf-1 production increasing
energy and receptor activity
on and so forth so at the end of the day
it all boils down to the myostatin and
father stand pathway these several
studies have confirmed this for example
the most important gene when it comes to
activating protein transcription
you cannot build muscle without this
transcription factor and sure enough
master and [ __ ] blocks accurate in one
so before protein synthesis even begins
you need to down regulate this gene as
you can see the correlation is
insane highest one on record another
study here shows the same thing
people that reduce my standard most
after each workout session
are the ones that put on the most muscle
are the ones who tend to put on the most
muscle and this study here explains the
reason why old women
why it's very very hard to put on muscle
if you're an old woman mainly because as
you can see when an old person trains
they're able to lower my stance
significantly when a young person trains
obviously they have the biggest
reduction in my outstanding which is why
young people put on muscle so fast
and even young women also lower my stat
and to a significant
extent but when it comes to old women it
is very hard for them to lower mastering
from training so no matter how hard they
train
some of them are going to have a hard
time putting on muscle once again
showing you how important
my statin is even if you're a natural
person and that's also the reason why
females in general
can never be as big as men it's not just
testosterone obviously to start someone
plays a role
but even testosterone's role involves
the father's phyllostatin pathway
women just don't have favorable
myostatin genotypes
very very hard for them to manipulate it
after training and another
very underrated thing about myostatin is
people forget it is more predictive
of insulin sensitivity so just by
looking at somebody's myostatin levels
you can pretty much tell
if they're insulin resistant or not
right so a lot of you skinny fat guys
out there a lot of the dad bods
a lot of obese individuals who are very
very very high insulin resistance
nine out of ten times is because they're
not down regulating the master and
draining enough they're either enacted
or they don't train too frequently
and that is why almost all the powerful
my style inhibitors
are banned by the world anti-doping
agency now back to the studies as you
can see here biggest drop in myostatin
came from the full body group that
obviously makes sense they're using the
most muscles and i've been telling you
guys for years
year after year after year full body
workouts are no
joke especially if you're natural and
especially if you have average
or sub-optimal genetics right you're
still going to get a mystery reduction
if you only train your upper body or
only train your lower body
but you're going to get the best bang
for your buck if you want to maximize
muscle growth and you want to maximize
fat loss
you're gonna get the best bang for your
buck if you do full body workouts oh
obviously if you do
things that are similar push pull up or
lower long story short you want to train
your entire body
you can split it up if you want you're
not gonna get the exact same results
but you'll always be better off than the
people who are only training lags or
only training their upper bodies
and the same goes for phyllis satin
right you want to maximize phallic
science production
do full body workouts train your entire
body and show enough the results
translated into muscle mass and which is
fat and what's fascinating about this is
the fact that
most of these studies everyone is eating
the same amount of protein same amount
of calories
which i which actually does a disservice
to full body workouts because
you have to increase your protein intake
and your caloric intake when you're
doing full body workout especially
protein
studies have shown if you're doing full
body workouts you cannot eat the same
amount of protein as a person who's just
doing splits it's common
[ __ ] sense once again i've been
telling you guys that for years
you cannot train chest back legs arms
delts all in one session and eat
the same amount of protein as the person
who just went in their chest and triceps
right
your body needs more nitrogen so most
studies actually compare full body to
any other type of
training actually not even done
correctly because they're not factoring
the fact that
you need more protein on full body
workouts which makes it even more
impressive
that a lot of these studies are showing
that full body workouts are still
producing equal or even better gains
even other people are actually
recovering and eating
sub optimally and once again here goes
the fat loss chart
right more muscle less fat best of both
worlds what else can you ask for
keep in mind guys it's not that i'm
biased towards full body workouts i
actually enjoy
splits a lot better they're more fun and
i dread my full body workout sessions
because they are long and they are
painful as [ __ ] but they get the job
done if you're trying to put on muscle
fast
and like i said if you have average
genetics if it was up to me i would do
splits
every single day for the rest of my life
because a lot more fun
a lot more enjoyable it's just it will
take you forever
to put on muscle and strength on uh
split training programs
unless of course like i said you in hand
so you have good genetics anyway i hope
this video helps i hope that answers the
question as far as how to maximize the
final standard of my style ratio
while training stay tuned for more
videos on the subject if you want to see

the other ways to lower my statin or

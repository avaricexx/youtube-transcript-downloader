hey guys going on Megan here all right
so let's take a look at this poll I'm
gonna break this video up into three
parts part one it's gonna be
um looking at the results of the poll
part two is going to be telling you guys
why this is horrible and part three is
going to be reading the comments and
answering a lot of frequently asked
questions all right let's get to it
number one uh again how much choline do
you eat per day for maximum testosterone
production and also muscle mass
followers whatever and to put in
perspective guys the RDA recommended
Airlines for choline is 550 so let's
round it up it's about 600 milligrams
okay keep in mind the RDA is the minimum
amount that you need
to prevent efficiencies and things like
that it's not the optimal amount okay
the RDA is never the optimal amount
usually the optimal amount is a lot
higher so the audio is the minimum and
look look how bad this is guys keep in
mind choline is your vitamin found in
Foods obviously your body makes a tiny
tiny amount of it not enough for
um the body's functions which is why
it's an essential
nutrient an essential vitamin
okay and choline is needed for again if
you struggle with ADHD choline is going
to help you because your body needs
choline to make acetylcholine
um your body needs clothing for again
most of protein synthesis fat loss
energy metabolism testosterone
production cholesterol metabolism immune
function uh methylation energy
production you you name it anything any
system in the body that's crucial for
just life or if you're an athlete if
you're in bodybuilding it doesn't matter
what it is every system in your body
needs choline okay and I could show you
the direct and indirect Pathways
involved in you know
you know the rules that cooling has in
the body right so and sure enough 92
percent of people based on studies 92
percent some studies show 94 some 91 but
roughly 92 percent of people are not
getting enough choline and I'm talking
about the audio so let that sink it 92
percent of people are not even getting
the minimum amount of codeine that you
need to function let alone to train hard
in the gym to recover from training to
lose fat to to to to to focus on
cognition and you name it right which is
another reason why I testosterone that
was a solo and that's also another
reason why
ADHD cases or through the roof right a
lot of you guys don't have enough
clothing so your body doesn't have
enough acetylcholine your body can um
your your neural transmitter balance is
off your testosterone production is
hindered um even creatine metabolism you
name it I mean I could just go on and on
into the nerdy details but
why is your choline intake so low guys
I'll tell you why you don't eat enough
eggs right what food has the most
choline well the top two is eggs and B
flavor right if you eat enough eggs and
at least usually you don't need more
than a ounce of liver a day you know in
fact you don't want too much liver but
if you eat enough eggs and you'll
recommended one ounce of liver a day
which I think everybody should eat not
medical device by the way you're getting
enough Coley
all right and I can show you guys
studies in fact let me not go off
attention so 31 one third of you
[ __ ] are not even eating
the audio look at that
less than 400 milligrams you Smiggle
[ __ ]
do you have any idea how much you
destroying Your Body by eating such a
low amount of choline
right and I bet you these guys are going
to go to the doctor and he's just gonna
be like hey let me put you on this
medication oh you must have ADHD here
take this oh you can't you can't build
muscle it must be your genetics no your
diet is trash like I always say
now let's look at 400 to 600 milligrams
which is the LDA 17 of you guys are here
which is also bad because remember the
audio is the minimum for 150 pound man
who probably goes to the office works
and comes home
you're lifting weights if you're natural
you're lifting weights you you uh full
body workouts upper lower Push Pull high
frequency high volume there's no way you
should be eating the RDA that's the bare
minimum
so so far we have 31 plus 17 so 48
percent of you [ __ ] that's half
are technically not even getting the
abdominal monocholine now let's look at
Leonidas status right 601 to a thousand
milligrams
if you fall somewhere in that range you
fine right you're not optimal you're not
maximizing but again the the key it's
almost impossible to try to maximize
every single thing the keys will at
least be
close to Optimal right so it keeps to be
here
right now everyone is going to end up
here because life gets in a way
depending on your goals unless you're a
competitive bodybuilder most people
should be here when I do these polls
there's no reason in hell why you should
be a Smiggle [ __ ] or a baby
Kratos right so so far we have 20 of you
guys so one fifth of [ __ ] one
Faithfully [ __ ] is getting 600 to a
thousand which is slightly above the RDA
into optimal territory
one out of every five
now of course this is a poll on my
Channel That's not representative of the
entire population
um if this was the entire population
then of course it would be 90 of your
people here right because that's what
the studies show
um but this is still unacceptable
especially if you watch my videos you
gotta eat healthy guys nutrition is at
the foundation of everything
um and then
god mode Kratos 32 all right so one
third of you guys is getting a thousand
or more you know and getting like
everything is the limit you don't want
to overdo you know with anything
everything has an inverter you go right
so that doesn't mean that if you take
five thousand milligrams you know of
choline you know you're gonna be
infinitely better no everything has an
inverted you go but you should strive to
be between here and here depending on
your workload you know if it's a if it's
a day where you're doing a lot of
studying a lot of reading a lot of
homework depending on you know if you're
in college school whatever or you're
going to the gym a lot you have to
replenish your Colleen else you're going
to have brain fog you're gonna feel
tired as hell it's going to be very hard
for you to focus and your performance in
the gym is going to suck because once
again if choline is low acetylcholine is
low creatine metabolism is low
methylation is low
so your energy is going to be just trash
anyway let's look at the comments
all right learn to farm and add your
exercise you can separated egg wire
proteins when you want just an idea a
cheap easy way to get one percent
microbes all right uh thanks for waking
me up again 2355 actually they are back
in the diet yeah that never should have
left you die [ __ ] but yeah I'm
glad you taking it seriously you gotta
eat eggs and it's not just for choline
you guys know when I recommend the food
it's never because of just one nutrient
if I recommend a food is because it has
a ton of benefits right you have limited
macros limited space for fats carbs
protein calories therefore you want to
pick foods that hit three birds with one
stone
um and eggs are going to help you
knock out so many micronutrient
efficiency but anyway it acts every day
brother you damn right I remember eating
like three grams of Cody in a spot every
day two yeah yeah you guys know I'm not
you know real foods guys not supplements
right you know my rule when it comes to
supplements supplements should only be a
backup plan right if you want to buy
Alpha GPC or CDP choline all these
clothing supplements that's fine as long
as it's a backup plan and you're not
using it as your primary source of
clothing
also keep in mind that like I always say
most supplement companies are [ __ ]
trash right you don't know what they put
in the supplement and you don't even if
they put
choline in the supplement which most
don't most just put a bunch of fillers
you don't even know if they're putting
the right dose right so you're gonna end
up nutrient deficient anyway
right
but anyway I I just keep repeating
myself over and over with these
supplement talk but
um guarantee you after this video is
over a bunch of you [ __ ] you're
probably doing it right now uh opening
up a new tab and starting to order a
bunch of colony supplements instead of
thinking all right let me save my money
and buy a [ __ ] ton of eggs instead
all right um and by the way egg prices
Jesus they went through the roof lately
all right my fool yesterday was a fair
like protein shake two six two string
cheese butter coffee nice for the whole
day three years but
um let's see next
bro I've never heard of choline and I'm
well educating diet and fitness knowing
you I guess it increases testosterone
yeah I mean it's sad that most people
don't know about choline which is it's
not it's not new right it's not new it's
not like clothing just came out you know
um he says old as dirt it's just again
and the funny thing is most people don't
even take choline right they don't eat
enough choline from the dyes but they'll
go and supplement with nootropics
right oh I need my new job base for my
brain function and if you look at the
ingredients what is it they have choline
in there right either Alpha GPC or CP
codeine or whatever
so they're making you pay overpay
for nutrient you can actually get in
food
but better by availability and at least
you know what the [ __ ] is an act for the
most part
um but yeah code Lane increase your
testosterone and increases cognition
memory
um strength power
Focus
um like I said you know
it has antioxidant properties because it
breaks down into B chain
um which has been shown everstate I'm
going to show you guys where uh people
took B chain which is again your body
will make it from choline and they got
over 200 increase in testosterone it was
a young man
um in only like I think two and a half
weeks it's one of the upcoming videos
yeah Colleen is life guys but once again
92 percent of people are not getting
enough clothing
because your doctor told you don't eat
eggs don't eat eggs cholesterol oh my
God I can't stand that [ __ ]
um next uh my grandparents own the
chicken farm so I literally do you lucky
[ __ ] 20 fresh eggs every two
days eggs are my main sister protein
nice nice so you're definitely getting a
lot of choline
drop human growth hormone video me again
I mean I'm pretty sure I have in the
past but sure everything man is high
what role does Colleen play for tea
production I guess I already replied in
this one
[Music]
um
but yeah um like I said all the pathways
I listed earlier and there's even more
you know helps with blood flow helps
with I mean just so many things if you
name it if you could find a pathway a
critical pathway in the human body
choline helps in it
six hours a day one pound of red meat
nice nice nice eating like a man
two big ass 200 milligrams
um but uh yep yep
um it's found pretty much in everything
you eat uh but if you take others color
so you don't really need to go into
regular your mood it's not gonna put you
a dumbass you're a [ __ ] dumbass like
I hate when I see misinformation
it's from pretty much in everything you
eat yeah creatine is found a lot of
foods you eat it doesn't mean you're
getting enough of it
the [ __ ] like like how can you write
something that's stupid and think that
it makes sense
um and no it's not very abundant and oh
my God it's got such a clown
go online or go to chronometer and look
up
on 100 Grand basis the amount of choline
you get in
eggs in 100 grams of eggs and 100 grams
of beef flavor and 100 grams of The Next
Food it's night and day
okay
so stop acting like you just eat why do
you think 92 of population is deficient
in choline even though people are eating
two to three thousand calories a day
clearly it's not in every [ __ ] food
in enough quantities
but anyway um there's always this anyway
I actually could say in about 150 grams
and I used to have any money yeah so
you're getting plenty I'm carnivore
daily intake 10 eggs the fish oil
cooling should be abundant
um just had 10 eggs Legend
[ __ ] Legend eat your eggs guys don't
be scared of that cholesterol myth
not medical device
um not sure how much going is and I
gotta be chicken yo could you make a
series on basket man I mean I will I'm
pretty sure I already have a lot of
chairlifts on
on exercises but sure it's success a day
enough to get all that cooling
successfully they will give you plenty
of codeine and then you're gonna get the
rest from the rest of the food that you
eat
um
again if you watch my videos on like the
chair list best protein best fat best
carbs best whatever you you know if
you're eating those Foods you're gonna
get all your nutrients right
um I read this as much as uh please make
a test to boosting I've already did bruh
um you have five bags it's like the I
have very good
I've never heard of this probably not
much yeah this is sad this is sad that
so many people have never heard of
choline this really blows my mind
because again Colleen is not new Colleen
is not new at all decades old
um
I don't know what that is haha yeah this
is sad whatever three exits seven eggs a
day nice nice what's Colleen wow again
you see my point guys
you see what I mean your government
wants you weak low t low Focus ADHD you
name it
right
this is basic nutrition stuff that you
guys should learn in Middle School in
high school
the fact that a grown man or teenager
saying what is choline in 2023 blows my
mind but anyway too much going there
goes that [ __ ] there goes that [ __ ]
too much school Lincoln [ __ ] up your
mood and cognition there's always that
one [ __ ]
Megan says drink water too much water
will lead to water poisoning
you need to sleep guys be careful if you
sleep too long you're gonna be
there's always this [ __ ] idiot who
doesn't understand your voted you girls
but you want to cook it here this cookie
um
uh 1200 1400 sunflower eggs and criminal
lies what the hell is that wow um anyway
guys uh that's it that answers most of
your questions about Colleen I want to
make more videos on if you want where I
can show you the exact Pathways the
exact direct functions clothing has the
exact studies I mean there's endless
studies and coding endless studies
um review meta-analysis clinical trials
um double blind Placebo control studies
you name it but anyway guys get your
choline in get enough eggs and if you
eat the recommended you know I recommend
one ounce of beef liver a day obviously
cooked not that liver King [ __ ]
um but one ounce of uh beef flavor a day
um
and you'll you know five to six eggs
minimum you're gonna get plenty of
codeine trust me all right guys hope

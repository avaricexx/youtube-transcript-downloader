hey guys what's going on megan here
victor
[ __ ] richards what the [ __ ]
wednesday and you guys have requested
that i cover
this behemoth i want to call him a
legend because he had some of the best
genetics in the world
but he never competed in the mr olympia
regardless
best genetics if not top two
of all time i mean look at the packs
look at the [ __ ] quads
sources say anywhere from 32 to 36
inches
think about that his legs were bigger
than the irish person's
waist and even as a teenager
even as a young [ __ ] he had some crazy
genetics and obviously steroids just
took that
to the next level right anyway guys this
is another episode of what the [ __ ]
wednesday where we just talk about
genetic freaks or people who just have
impressive body parts make sure you get
caught up on the previous episodes
alright so let's
talk about victor richards i'm sure a
lot of you guys already familiar with
him
so let's go right into the stats
obviously he was five nine
five ten over 300 pounds which puts his
fat
free mass index at around 40. probably a
higher i'm actually being generous at
putting 40
because depending on who you asked this
guy was as heavy as 330 350 pounds so
even if he was
down to 10 percent body fat at around
300 pounds
that pushed them at 40 and to put into
perspective
all little was in the high 20s phil
heath in the low 30s so this guy
is blowing everyone out of the water no
one should weigh over 300 pounds
weighing
five nine with visible abs i mean this
guy's genetics were insane
and if we look at the rest of us what
the [ __ ] stats arms were rumored to be
26 inches waist again 32 to 36
fives 35 to 37 so once again
calves at 24 which is impressive because
most black people actually have shitty
calves
neck 22 inches to me this blows my mind
how is your neck bigger than most
people's legs
and obviously he was rumored to bench
over 600 pounds some say 650.
and surprisingly unlike a lot of the
crazy stats that are out there a lot of
people actually
you know a lot of veterans a lot of
bodybuilders actually confirm these
stats
that said he was ridiculously strong but
if you grew up in the 90s then you were
into bodybuilding you definitely heard
about him
and obviously where is he from you guys
guessed it
nigeria see i told you [ __ ] man
these nigerian people are not to be
[ __ ] with
the craziest bodybuilding genetics come
from nigeria
nigeria ghana and the cameroon congo
region if you want more detail on why
this region produces so many
bodybuilding genetics go look at my
video
on uh bbc genetics and my video on the
ufc fighters
but yeah a lot of the genetic freaks
come from this region this whole west
africa region and i already explained
why the whole malaria thing [ __ ]
right nigerian have some of the craziest
genetics when it comes to fast switch
muscles
and funny enough he actually reminds me
of rosso think about it actually look
like guys obviously
russell is another guy that i might
actually make a video on because he's
actually natty russell's actually that
he has some of the craziest genetics
i've
ever [ __ ] seen i mean look at his
[ __ ] legs
look at his squads victor actually
reminds me of what russell would look
like if he hopped on the juice
i mean think about it guys you check
russell you ask some sense of beans you
know what i'm talking about when i say
sense of beans
and you end up with victor richards
right and sure enough guess where
russell is from you guys just guessed
nigeria once again i'm telling you guys
i grew up in west africa i was born in
west africa
and i grew up surrounded by africans
from all different tribes all different
countries
no one came close in terms of genetics
when it came to nigerians
and people from ghana and the cameroon
congo region if you see an
african genetic freak nine out of ten
times from nigeria god
mark my word but anyway let's get back
to victor richard there goes his insane
progress over these i mean look at him
as a teenager guys look how big he was
as a teen you can't take all the drugs
in the world and you wouldn't even look
like the way he looked
on the left as a teenager look at that
face looks angry than a [ __ ]
like he didn't eat for three days
let's see the next picture once again
this is back in his younger days
all right look how much mass he was able
to put on his body once he hopped on you
know what
but even then i mean just look at this
man look at this
for someone so young and again he was
over 200 pounds as a teenager
at 5-9 massive massive
genetic advantage again there he is as a
teenager
looking better than most of us would
look after 20 years of lifting
on [ __ ] trend another one here i
think this was uh when he's close to his
20s probably late teens early 20s
it's the famous shot obviously it was
recorded with a [ __ ] potato but it's
the famous shot of him
at the gas posing event with dorian
yates as you could tell they were all
out of shape
holding a lot of water but again it was
a guest posing event look at that uh
and that's another thing like he was so
big but he really didn't have
a [ __ ] bubble gut so he was actually
able to keep a pretty decent weight for
someone his size
as you can see here another shot very
impressive physique i mean those
quads a piece now don't get me wrong we
never really saw him
diced and shredded so you can see
there's not a lot of separation in his
legs
but if he had competed if he had taken
by the building
extremely seriously and decided to go
for the mr olympia
we would have seen the physique like
noah there was another shot here i mean
look at his forearms
oh my goodness and once again there goes
that waist i told you but look at that
he's doing like a mini vacuum
and this is one of my favorite pictures
of vape because you could see how tiny
his waist was
and his massive proportions all right
it's desperate kind of a weak point but
hey [ __ ] it and last but not least is
the picture of him here next to don as
you can tell even in his what
50s he still had monster [ __ ] arms
but anyway guys that's it you guys
requested his video

at the olympia but anyway guys comment

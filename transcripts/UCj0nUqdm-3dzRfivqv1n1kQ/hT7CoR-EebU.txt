hey guys what's going on megan here
finally the milk video you guys have
been on my ass about that
um the milk video is finally here and
i'm gonna explain to you exactly why
to this day i still believe that milk is
the number one
muscle building food period it's not
even close now obviously you could build
muscle eating just about anything
but i'm going to explain why milk is
just superior from my skinniest
to my fattest milk has been my best
friend and no i'm not sponsored by
any milk companies or any of the dairy
industry
none of that [ __ ] this is from my
experience keeping it raw
and honest alright so why am i such a
big fan of milk why do i recommend it so
much and obviously
uh all subscribers already know all the
different stages of me and right from
fat kid mode uh to two years after
lifting
which really showed me how bad my
genetics were i was 142 pounds
15 body fat and again this is after
tweezer lifting doing the traditional
bro split bs
um and i just couldn't get past 142 each
time i try to
increase my calories i would just get
fat as hell so you guys already know the
story
and then eventually uh you know i
discovered full body workouts
and everything changed right nuclear
silver load hsp training you guys know
the whole story
and i just started putting on mass like
crazy and this is
this is how i know that this is how you
know that nuclear solar and full body
workouts
um change the game because that was
after my newbie phase
right that was years after i already got
most of my gains
from the new face and what helped me as
far as training you guys already know
for body workouts blah blah blah um but
as far as food goes it was milk
it's not even close you know out of
everything i ate what gave me the most
gains
even when i was doing carb back loading
everything you could think about it was
always milk
right um it allowed me to break through
every single plateau
all the way until i quit bodybuilding
even around 2013 2014 right
so milk has been my best friend even now
2020 and my heaviest and my fattest
uh where i barely even you know take
training seriously
i was still able to maintain a lot of my
size obviously nico solo play you know
plays a huge role
um but milk is still here right i'm
never gonna stop drinking milk
and even if i do decide to start
bodybuilding again
um still same thing my diet is mainly
going to consist of milk
so if you are a skinny guy or skinny fat
which is my genetic skinny fat um and
you're struggling to put on mass
that's that's your formula i said in
every video nucleus overload combined
with hsp training right
now again full body workout is always
going to be king you know i'm always
going to recommend that
um but you could use push pull splice
whatever and obviously
um milk milk is the key but let's get to
the five reasons why milk is so
freaking powerful when it comes to
packing size
number one right people forget whey
protein hey
protein shake protein shake where does
it come from it comes from milk
right it's amazing how we so used to
protein shakes and supplements that we
don't even pause and think um
you know what is the source without milk
there's no whey protein
right milk has whey and caffeine right
eighty percent of mucus casein so you're
getting
fast digesting protein right in a formal
way so you're going to get
your leucine that's going to spike
protein synthesis and accurate i'm tall
and stuff
and you're also going to get casein
right which is your slow digesting
protein so you're getting the best of
both worlds
in one superfood so it's ideal
pre-workout post-workout and before bed
right
keeping those amino acids circulating in
your blood remember you're not building
muscle without amino acids right
self-explanatory so the number one
supplement for bodybuilding right whey
protein and number one supplement from
bodybuilding
counts for milk right number two your
absorption and the body availability of
milk
whey protein and obviously milk have the
highest bioavailability you know you
absorb and digest 99 to 100 of it as
long as you're not intolerant of course
so not only are you getting a good
source of protein but your body's gonna
make the most out of it
number three hydration if you watch my
videos
you know how much i emphasize water in
fact watch the massive video out there
on water you know it's another thing
that so many lifters
uh you know don't pay enough attention
to muscle
is 75 water i don't know how many times
you guys need to hear this
muscle is not mainly protein it's mainly
water
70 to 75 percent of your muscle is what
and i'm not talking about just water
weight or you know
from being bloated no actual muscle
tissue is 70
water that means if you take if you want
to put on 10 pounds of muscle
lean muscle right seven pounds out of
that ten pounds is gonna be water
but yeah almost everyone i talk to
everyone i see in the gym are dehydrated
right show me a jack dude who does not
drink a lot of water at least a gallon
of water a day it's impossible i
guarantee i challenge you
show me one jack dude who does not drink
at least one gallon of water a day
and that's that least now what does that
have to do with milk it's what
milk has a higher hydration index
then water so not only you have
something that's going to give you your
amino acids
right your fast digesting your slow
digesting protein
something that your body is going to
absorb to the max
the max amount of amino acids your body
can take is 10 grams per hour which is
obviously from whey protein
but you also have something that's gonna
hydrate you
which again hydration like i said is the
most important thing when it comes to
building muscle right muscle you need
amino acids
you need water you need energy you're
getting all of that
for milk there's no other food on earth
that has this
deadly combination here
number four and that's the example i
always bring up right in my sleeping
video
i'm always going to refer to babies why
because remember
the time in your life when you put on
the most muscle is when you're a baby
when i was doing all my research on
hypertrophy and i was trying to think
outside the box and look for
you know you know all the instances of
muscle growth i looked at babies because
that's
when we put on the most muscle mass the
baby doubles in muscle mass not just fat
mass
pure muscle mass from the time we born
to the time we're about six months old
we double in lean muscle mass so you
want to observe muscle growth that's a
great place to start looking
right and you know we're doing it
naturally obviously right babies not
getting swollen for steroids it's mainly
milk guys
sleep and milk all babies do during the
time of our lives when we grow the most
is sleep and drink milk
right look at nature you want to find
answers about hypertrophy or whatever
just look at nature guys and keep in
mind back to the hydration point
babies don't drink water right as any
parent we rarely give our kids you know
[ __ ] water you know just milk it's
enough to hydrate them it's enough to
give them the calories
and their amino acids now a lot a lot of
the arguments that people have against
milk is they like to say well you know
milk is not made for humans
it's what you give to a calf to turn
into a big cow or a big bull or whatever
no [ __ ] that's why i want milk you know
the argument that people are trying to
use against milk
is what makes milk so [ __ ] powerful
it turns a calf into a [ __ ] bowl
and obviously lastly appetite right
because we all know at the end of the
day for you to put on mass
you need to be in a surplus period right
you're not going to go from 140
to 180 without being in a surplus that's
physically impossible
right you got to be in a surplus and the
issue that most skinny guys have
and i was one of them right was appetite
right
that's when the number one complaint oh
megan i can't eat enough or i can't
sleep enough whatever
same thing when i was training lazy
lying you know appetite was the biggest
issue at first
most skinny guys that train
that progressively overload they haven't
do enough volume they do every single
thing
that they have to do at the gym but when
they leave the gym
that's where the [ __ ] up right they just
don't get enough food don't get enough
water don't get enough sleep
milk helps with that because you don't
need a big appetite
to drink milk my subscribers remember i
used to chug down
milk and shore you know liquid liquid
meals are the key when you're skinny and
you can't get enough food in
you got to use liquid meals to get those
calories in
so when i couldn't break 150 i just
drink more milk
when i couldn't break 160 170 180
190 every single time i wanted to break
a plateau i just increased my milk
intake
obviously my macros still had to adjust
and things like that but
it but it was mainly milk even now even
though i quit serious bodybuilding i
still train i still go to the gym you
know because like i said it's
something i'm gonna do until i die you
know i'm no longer obsessing about
you know uh all the little details
you know that come along with when you
train seriously for bodybuilding but i
still lift
and when i wanted to get to 250 it's
just not going to happen because i got
stuck at 235 i literally cannot get to
250 because
it's just it's just too much way too
much milk
way too much food and i just don't sleep
enough to you know to fuel that kind of
growth
because i'm always busy doing [ __ ]
always working but
milk is how i got that heavy now just
imagine if i added steroids on top of
all that
i'll probably be 250 260 easy and this
time i'd actually be muscle instead of
just you know
all the fat i put on i mean just imagine
this entire journey
from 142 all the way to 235
from 142 to 235 i don't know how much i
[ __ ] weighed when i first started
um but obviously it was less than 142.
but from 142 to 35
that's uh that's over 90 pounds right
even if half of that is fact obviously
it's not all muscle right we're not
stupid here right so even if half of
that is fat
that's still 40 to 45 pounds right the
main
food that got me there was milk now can
you imagine
if that was combined with steroids that
was combined with
test and deca and dhd derivatives and
growth hormone insulin all that [ __ ]
i'd be [ __ ] huge right so just to
show you guys
milk will take you a long way even as a
natural
so that's the power of milk three things
to keep in mind number one
only use it if you're trying to put on
mass this is
not for guys who are trying to cut down
it's not for guys we're trying to lean
out
that's mainly if you're trying to bulk
up or if you're trying to put on mass
if you're skinny and you know you have a
shitty appetite or you know pretty much
you're just trying to put on masks right
don't abuse milk if you're trying to
lose weight right it's actually
counterproductive because like i said
it's not going to fill you up
you're going to be hungry again you know
in like two hours
and that's gonna defeat the whole
purpose of staying full all day now if
you're cutting and you don't have issues
with appetite and hunger and things like
that and by all means you know you could
cut in you know you could cut with milk
second thing is avoid milk if you
lactose intolerant
by the way i'm lactose intolerant but
guess what i use lactose free milk
yes it costs more guys if you see how
much money i spent of
milk during all these years like i
should be a majority owner right now
because lactose free milk costs way more
than regular milk but
you know i didn't have a choice you know
i'm lactose intolerant than a
[ __ ] right
so if you drink milk and you know you
lactose intolerant obviously you're
gonna know because you're gonna be super
bloated you're gonna fall
all day which is obviously the sign that
you're not properly digesting the milk
so don't waste your time right
if you lactose intolerant use lactose
free milk or avoid it all together
and lastly monitor your hormone levels
right there's a lot of debate
out there as far as what milk does to
your hormones now
normally your liver should break down
most of the estrogen that's in milk
if there is any depending on where
you're getting your milk from
but you know studies are mixed some
studies show that you know it's not a
serious thing to worry about some
studies show that your testosterone
levels might plummet
and your estrogen levels might rise so
just monitor your hormone levels when if
you start drinking milk
um and you have signs of highest now
keep in mind you don't
you don't want your estrogen to be too
low obvious you know obviously estrogen
has a place even in the male body
but at the same time you also don't want
it to rise outside of the normal range
because then that's going to interfere
where you're going to have a dropping
releasing hormone
and that's going to lower your
testosterone levels so keep an eye on
your hormones whenever you start to
drink a lot of milk
all right guys that's it milk is my
biggest secret and now you know why

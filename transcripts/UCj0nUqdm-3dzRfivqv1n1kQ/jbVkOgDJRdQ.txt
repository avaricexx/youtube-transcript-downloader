hey guys what's going on megan here
quick video on why
uh competition increases testosterone if
you ride my
work or if you watch my previous videos
you know that uh
out of the top things that you can do to
increase testosterone naturally
uh competition is uh is one of them it's
one of the things that i mentioned a lot
and and i've got a lot of questions as
far as you know not only the mechanism
behind it but just the practical answer
as to why you know why is it that
just the simple act of competing um
increases testosterone and i'm gonna
explain that in this video
uh it's not just um competing it's
actually winning
you know uh winning increases the stats
wrong now don't get me wrong you know
it's not gonna bring you to style
someone that was from 500 to a thousand
right you know it's not like a drastic
you know improvement
but competing chronically you know uh
definitely
has its advantages and obviously if you
if you're a natural person if you're a
natural trainee
anything anchors your testosterone is
worth it you know naturally of course
so why is it that competing increases
testosterone first keep in mind
uh we live in a society where anything
that makes you a man anything
that increases testosterone levels is
pretty much you know looked down upon
and i think that includes competing you
know
um as a male competing is just part of
our dna it's something that we do even
for fun you know sometimes if you just
look at the way
boys in iraq look at the way men in iraq
likes to compete even with our friends
it's nothing personal it's not always a
life or death scenario
you know but it's literally in our dna
you know it's part of how we evolved
but obviously like i said you know we
live in a society where even competing
is looked down upon you know so as i was
saying earlier
the actual act of competing is actually
winning right you got to win because
actually if you compete and lose you
actually have a reduction in the stats
so
you know but the actual act of competing
and winning
you know [ __ ] levels and that could
be through sports that could be through
physical again physical competition and
in some cases you know some studies even
mental
you know competition but why is it so
first let's look at you know how
testosterone is produced right
i'm gonna skip a lot of details because
i made so many videos on testosterone
that
uh my old subscribers are just gonna get
bought to that but if you're new
just remember how to start selling
produce it starts with your brain you
know i'm again i'm gonna skip the mid
steps you know your hypothalamus your
pituitary gland gonadotropin
blah blah blah just know it starts with
your brain right your hypothalamus
signals your pituitary gland to release
luteinize the hormone which goes to your
balls
and obviously converts cholesterol into
testosterone that's the short
version if you want the long version
watch my other videos when i go to the
details i'll just pick up a biology book
all right now why am i showing you this
because it's important to realize that
it starts with the brain
i repeat testosterone production starts
with the brain not the testicles
the brain the hypothalamus has to
release gonadotropin releasing hormone
what does that have to do with
competition
simple the brain has to sense a need
for testosterone production or reason
for testosterone production it doesn't
just do it
out of the blue one of the things that
the brain looks at is obviously your
energy status
right you guys know before your body
invests in reproduction which is the
endocrine system to start some whatever
your body has to first invest in
survival you know keeping your [ __ ]
keeping your basic functions a lot
so before your body invests into
reproduction it has to make sure
that just your basic needs are taken
care of which is why when you're in a
caloric deficit your testosterone levels
drop
right because your body's thinking hey
smashing reproduction is not
the priority right now let's focus on
survival and that's also why when you're
in a caloric surplus your testosterone
levels increase right because your body
realizes hey
you know leptin is good this individual
has more than enough calories
and resources to uh to not only provide
for himself but for a family and that's
why your body starts increasing
testosterone production
basing energy status now what does that
have to do with competition why is it
that
winning increases testosterone well
reason number one is simple
right access to resources guys keep in
mind we've spent
more time as caveman and you know
hunters and gatherers than we have
as men in a civilized society right
if you look at their the history of homo
sapiens you know
90 to 99 percent of it was just us being
in the wild being hunters and gatherers
caveman blah blah blah right we've only
been living in this modern society
for about one percent of our entire
existence you know sometimes even less
depending on how far you you know how
far back you want to go
so your brain is still operating you
know you know under the the assumption
that you know
you're living in the wild you know you
have that caveman mentality you're
competing for resources
on and so forth so when you win a
competition
your primal brain thinks hey you know
this guy now has
access to resources yes he's gonna have
access to food is gonna have access
to um to to water to shelter
so your brain increases your
testosterone production in fact one of
the videos i have coming up is on the
placebo effect that i mentioned all the
time you know you gotta understand
perception is a huge thing your brain
just perceiving
you know uh that you in a better
situation
socially starts to increase your
testosterone levels
so when you win the competition even if
it's basketball or
soccer or boxing or whatever your brain
actually thinks
hey this guy just defeated a foe and he
now
he now has access to resources even if
it's even if that's not the case
the second reason is obviously fanning
off rivals right
because if you not have access to
resources now you got to protect those
resources right so
and so so why one of the benefits of
increased testosterone is increased
muscle mass
increase strength increase bone density
oh that's all the things that make you
stronger
why it's because your body's literally
planning for the future it's like hey
this guy
has access to resources he's gonna have
to be able to protect those resources
and we see the same thing in animals you
know we see that in chimps gorillas
birds fish you name it the moment they
start winning when they win competition
the testosterone levels increase
and over time you know as long as they
maintain a dominant position
their physiology changes you know for
fish you know they start to display
colors
you know other animals you know they get
bigger stronger you know just like
humans
and like i said it's a chronic thing
right it's not it's not something that's
gonna happen overnight
you know but it's literally your body
pushing you you know
in that um in that direction
and finally the third reason why your
testosterone levels go up after you win
a competition
is common sense right in fact it's the
number one reason
why you have testosterone in the first
place for reproduction right your body
thinks okay
well this guy's not in a position to
reproduce you know he has the resources
he has the ability to protect and defend
those resources
now it's time to reproduce you know
because remember your testosterone
levels go up what else goes up
your sperm quality your sperm quantity
your confidence
right and eventually you know down the
road
uh your attractiveness you know remember
guys with higher testosterone
not only you're more confident but also
more attractive to females
and that's all it boils down to don't
let no one tell you otherwise right
life boils down to passing on your genes
right every single thing that we do
subconsciously you're consciously you
know boils down to sex
as much as we live in a society that
tries to ignore it
you know that's really all it boils down
to remember men have evolved to pass on
their genes to as many partners as
possible
women is the opposite but like i said
i'm not going to go off on attention
here
so those are the top three reasons why
testosterone levels increase
after competitions and to be specific
after winning
so that's why um year after year you
know i actually encourage men to keep
competing you know
like i said it's not a drastic increase
in your testosterone levels right it's
not like you're gonna you know
double your t levels and you know be
swole overnight
but like i said any step in the right
direction is good you know compete
but there's friendly competition you
know and keep in mind video games don't
count actually you know
studies have shown that uh this type of
competition only uh
increases the saturn levels when you
actually perceive uh
that your social status went up and for
some reason when people win at video
games they don't get the same
increase in uh in testosterone levels
that we see when people actually win
important things like sports other forms
of competition
and the interesting about this is that
even if you perceive even if you think
you won
but i've done studies where people were
actually fooled into thinking that one
even though the the game was actually
rigged in a favor they still got the
increase in testosterone right so
it's not just a matter of effort it's
just a matter of perception you know the
moment the brain perceives
that you know that you view better uh
as as shallow as it sounds it increases
your testosterone levels
it's the same thing with social status
whenever someone gets gets a promotion
whenever people graduate whenever
a person is a sign in a leadership role
uh that person's testosterone levels
also go up right so it's all about
perception
so um compete right don't let society
bully you into thinking that competition
is bad and you know it's a sign of
insecurity and blah blah blah no
compete you know compete with your
friends compete with your people
strangers it's healthy it's healthy
mentally
also winning has positive effects on
your mood you know don't forget your
serotonin levels go up and all that so
winning is actually a very good
anti-depressant believe it or not so
anyway hope this video helps i wanted to
keep it short and answer the questions
as far as why competition
and winning increases assassin levels um
now keep in mind this is just a very
small piece of the puzzle
there are a lot of other things you have
to do to optimize your hormone levels
um so you know don't see that as like
you know
the magic pill you know it's a very very
small piece of the entire puzzle
but it's good to know nevertheless all

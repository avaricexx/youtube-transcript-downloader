hey guys what's going on megan here you
guys have been asking for this video for
so damn long finally here ranking the
best
tricep exercises all right let's get
straight to it here are the five
categories we have i'm about to nut
that's the very very best of the best
exercise
uh we have effin amazing we have you're
right so that's right there in the
middle
right it's not too bad it's not too good
we have bad and we have to get the [ __ ]
out of here right so those are the
movements that i'm not even gonna waste
my time with
and again uh this is based on if you
could only pick one exercise for the
rest of your life what exercise would it
be
so that's how i'm writing these
exercises because at the end of the day
every movement is good right every
movement has its uses every
movement has a purpose um so it's really
really hard to find a
terrible exercise um so that's why i
have to use the criteria
of if you can only pick one right all
right so let's get started triceps
triceps man i love triceps so
let's just pick them at random so we
have the dumbbell french press
right and that's the seated version
believe it or not
this one is i'm i'm a boxing category i
love this exercise if you've been
watching my videos for a long time you
know how much i swear by it
not only it's amazing as stretching the
[ __ ] out of your triceps for hsp
training of course
um but it targets the long head um
better than almost every movement
so really good emg activation you can
really
progressive overload uh more wraps more
weight more time on the tension you can
hold it in the stretch position
very very very uh underrated exercise in
my opinion
uh next up we have the one on version
i'm gonna put that one at [ __ ]
amazing um
you know again that should go in the
same category but that one is you know
that one has some downsides
it's one of them at a time again there's
nothing wrong with that but
i'm all about time right time efficiency
trying to get at the gym as quick as
possible so you can focus on recovery
and things like that
so you know no one really has time to do
one of my time i prefer the two own
version
um unless you know if you're doing a bro
split or you're doing home day whatever
then you know it doesn't hurt to do one
off but yeah this movement in my opinion
is the king of uh the long head of your
triceps
next up is um close great bench press
close quick bench press
believe it or not if i could only pick
one exercise for my triceps
i'm gonna put that one at amazing i'm
gonna put down that amazing and i'll
tell you why right
um simply because not only i'm gonna be
hitting the
you know uh you know most of my triceps
but obviously you're gonna get some some
pack involvement
and it's mainly upper pecs right and
everyone and i mean everyone can benefit
from um you know a better a bigger upper
you know upper pack development the
reason why it's not higher on the list
is simply because it's not hitting the
long head of your triceps
um it's not hitting it a lot you know
what i mean um
which is you know again which is fine
but most people are already doing bench
presses
they're already doing incline presses so
you're really hitting the
lateral head of your triceps um
regardless of your split
you know so that's why i put so much
more emphasis on the long hair because
that's the one that most people barely
hit
so yeah so i'm going to put that one out
amazing believe it or not behind the
neck press
is a great exercise for your triceps you
know people think it's just a shoulder
exercise if you do high volume
high frequency uh behind the neck press
which is again
one of my favorite exercises for
shoulders as long as your shoulders are
healthy of course
you're gonna feel it in your triceps so
i'm gonna put that one
believe it or not yeah i'm gonna put
that one at amazing you know um because
you're getting a lot of tricep you know
activation
you're getting your long hand your lung
head is involved because of the position
in your arm
and you're still getting some other hat
involvement not to mention
you're getting your doubts you're
getting your upper traps you know things
like that
um so again it's not really seen as a
tricep movement but trust me
this thing will kill your triceps um so
let's see
next next next diamond push up don't put
it down push and say you're right you
know you're right bro you know it's just
it's a you know again push-ups is a you
know great way to build your packs great
way to build your triceps but
uh when it comes to uh um increasing the
workload over time progressively
overloading
um whether that is more weight or more
reps it
it kind of becomes you know a bit
impractical right because it's very easy
to get
super strong at push-ups and now you got
to stop putting a backpack on stop
putting weights on your back
or you you can obviously do more reps
right which like which is what i
normally recommend
but you become so strong at uh push-ups
so fast that eventually you'll have to
do like
100 reps just to feel it you know and
again it's not time efficient so
great exercise if you're a beginner and
stuff like that but eventually it's very
hard to uh you know
keep overloading as you adapt so i'm
gonna put it at you all right
right next tricep push down
now this one is um this one is a tough
one
uh and keep in mind this one is the
kevin levrone version right you guys
know i'm a big fan of kevin levrone
and his version of doing the tricep push
down uh
really really hits the crap out of your
outer head
i'm gonna put that one at your right
right
for many reasons uh again you're not
really getting a nice stretch
um the negative portion is not really
you know the eccentric phase is not
um that dramatic so
it's going to be very hard for me to put
it higher but you know again it's still
a very good exercise
uh for your triceps next kickbacks man
get the [ __ ] out of here right
there's so much people doing kickbacks i
get mad it's like again don't get me
wrong you're going to get a lot of
energy activation
uh on the long header you try to be
doing kickbacks but
it's not something i would pick if i
want to maximize tricep development as
fast as possible
you know the the stretch is non-existent
um you could try to do this centric slow
negative but
again there are better alternatives
again i'm not saying that this is an
exercise that doesn't have its place
right it has its place in some routines
[ __ ] sometimes when i do home workouts
believe it or not i do try some
kickbacks but that's because i have
nothing else
all right so back to what i was saying
earlier this list based on
if you had to pick one out of all these
exercises and it definitely wouldn't be
try some kickbacks
doesn't mean i hate it though doesn't
mean i hate it it's just bad
alternatives
now for home workouts i definitely
recommend it right because no one has
you know [ __ ] uh cable priorities at
home
all right next uh skull crushers believe
it or not
i'm gonna put skull crushers at amazing
right [ __ ] amazing simply because
it's right there in the middle
it targets your long head not as much as
the french press but it still targets
your long head
and if you wanted to target you're going
to get even more you could just you know
uh
bring the buff you know behind your head
as opposed to your forehead
so it's a very very good movement and it
also activates you know the other head
of your triceps to some extent
very very um good movement uh the only
reason why it's not hard is because
it leads to a ton of elbow issues as you
start increasing the weight over time
um but again you know you could also fix
that by using different machines you can
use the smith machine
you can move the the the angle of the
bench around and that should alleviate
some of the elbow pain
all right next up you have
uh the regular press down right regular
press down not the kevin levrone press
down just a regular brush down
uh this one is again same thing right
you're right bruh
right there in the middle um not lower
not higher
uh next uh we have what the hell
i'll put this baby twice oh well yeah so
put this one twice
same [ __ ] in fact i'll keep it down here
all right we'll just pretend like this
one's not here all right next we have
dips
i'm about to [ __ ] not dip step steps
if you i think i did the video on chess
already but you saw how i ranked it
dips are king guys when it comes to
triceps and pecs
it's so hard to find a movement that
that mimics
or that has all the benefits of dips
you're hitting your outer head
uh you know your long head is not too
active but you're getting a
really really good stretch on your
triceps um
on the way down right you're also going
to get a trap you know a stretch on your
pecs
uh very good exercise very underrated um
yes
it kind of gets harder to uh you know to
add weight over time
simply because you know not everyone has
the every gym has the bell now no not
every gym has to
the you know [ __ ] chains you can put
on your neck but
you could always do high reps and you're
not going to get to
you know 100 200 wrap as fast as you
will
doing push-ups so still an amazing
exercise
definitely up there when it comes to
tricep development uh next you have to
pull over because believe it or not the
pull over used to be used as a tricep
movement you know it hits your triceps
the longer your triceps
it hits your uh your pecs in a stretch
position
and it obviously hits your legs as well
you know bodybuilders you know you know
in the old days you should love that
movement um but
as far as tricep goes get the [ __ ] outta
here right i'm not gonna give you a
tricep routine and be like oh don't
forget to pull over
[ __ ] that much better alternatives
uh again next you have kickbacks with
the cable
this one i'm gonna put it at bat i'm not
gonna put that get the [ __ ] out right
because you actually get more attention
with the cable
right whereas with the dumbbell version
you know it's
you know just be happy that i put it
back for all the guys who love kickbacks
out there just be happy that i put it up
here instead of down here right
again i'm not saying it's useless
exercise but
when you compare it to all the movements
here it has to be knocked down
right but you will get a crazy pump
though i'll give you that you know like
you'll get a crazy pump
doing kickbacks you know especially when
you're doing hsp and
you focus on the p part of your speed um
you get a crazy pump so if that's what
you're going for
you want her to use cable kickbacks
next you have the french press with the
cables i want to put that one
at this is tough because you guys know i
love french press man it's
you know it's uh it's the king for the
long hair but i'm going to put that one
at you all right simply because
it's not practical as you get stronger
and stronger and stronger over time
but like i said it's going to happen the
longer you lift um
you get to a point where you know you
you only confined to high rep work
because you're so [ __ ] strong that
the cable is not
it's not enough weight plus this the
stretch is not as crazy as the dumbbell
variation
all right so i'm going to put it at your
right and again it hits the long head of
your triceps
um but um actually i can't put it at you
all right man i can't put in the same
category as regular press down so
i'm gonna bump it up a little bit i'm
gonna bump it up it's [ __ ] amazing
now because again anything that hits the
long head is definitely gonna get a
bonus
uh because it's the most important head
of your triceps
next you have dumbbell skull crushes uh
i'm gonna put it at i'm gonna put it
[ __ ] amazing right right up there
with the you know regular skull crosses
you know and simply because
again long head are you triceps being
activated plus
uh you get a lot less elbow pain
doing that movement um because you can
really you know make it more natural
plus you can really stretch your long
head if you go
you know far back enough so [ __ ]
amazing
um next believe it or not again military
press
one of my favorite movements for
shoulders it's gonna hit your triceps
right if you lock out if you go all the
way at the top
you do high volume high frequency uh
you're gonna
feel it in your triceps guaranteed um so
i'm gonna put that one at your right
right
simply because it's not you're not gonna
feel it as much as you'll feel it behind
the neck brush
you know but again it's still a good
tricep
builder um next you have the floor press
same thing right flow price i'm gonna
put it right there we're [ __ ] amazing
because it's
you know very similar to the close grip
bench press you know limit your range of
motion
so you're not you know you don't go low
enough to activate your packs or put
your packs in a stretch position
so it's really tricep work um very good
for the outer head
not so good for the lat for the longer
head of your triceps
next uh we have dips but the machine
version
i'm not gonna put it at i'm about to not
write simply because
you know the moment the machine is
involved if you watch my other videos
you know what i'm talking about moment
of machine is evolved
it's going to lose some points right
again not not saying there's anything
wrong with machines but you're not
hitting your stabilizer muscles you're
not you're not you're not getting all
the benefits
that you get from um the free weight uh
version moving your body to space so
i'll put this one
at um ah this is tough
this is very tough because i do love
dips um and even the machine version you
you know you're getting a really really
good pump
uh if you squeeze at the bottom i'm
gonna put that one at you all right all
right i'm gonna put that one there
actually no i can't put it on you all
right because
price downs are down there yeah i'm not
playing that [ __ ] next to
[ __ ] push-ups so i want to put that
amazing right
um you can really focus on your triceps
because it has to scroll higher than
than these things here all right next
you have the press downs with the rope
again you're right it's just an
overrated exercise yes it's good for
your triceps but everybody does that
you know already so um it's definitely
not something i would pick if i only
have one movement for my triceps
uh next you have the
actually i'm gonna keep that one for
last all right so next you have the
regular bench press right
regular bench press for triceps
believe it or not again i'm gonna put
this one up here right
right next to closed grip bench press
because most people underestimate how
much tricep is involved
when you do standard bench press it's a
lot of tricep work guys
in fact the majority of your strength
from the bench press comes from your
triceps
not your pecs you know just look at the
amount of weight you can move when
you're doing a bench press and then look
at the amount of way you're moving when
you remove the tricep which
pretty much makes it into a dumbbell fly
huge difference
right that tells you that your tricep um
is actually uh providing the
the majority of the fibers when you're
doing a bench press
so yeah uh the only reason why it's not
higher again it's
very very bad activating the long head
of your triceps
and last but not least is this exercise
not the funny thing is
years ago i would have made fun of this
exercise right i would i would probably
put it and get the [ __ ] out of here
right
that's the planet fitness you know um
[ __ ] tricep movement and tricep
exercise but
but the reason i'm gonna put it at you
all right
as opposed to bad i'll get the [ __ ] out
of here right
it's simply because if you're doing hsb
right or you're doing an s part and for
some reason you can't do french prize
and you want to focus on the negative
you want to focus on the slow eccentric
right you want to use as much weight as
possible and just focus on a heavy
negative
this exercise is amazing simply because
you can use both your arms
for the for the concentric part and then
you can let go of the other arm
right and then resist the eccentric it's
amazing it's an amazing feeling
and you locked into place there's not a
lot of body you know body english
uh it's all triceps try that if you have
this machine at your gym
try it out so i'm going to put that one
at you all right right because it's
going to hit
a little bit of your long head and a
little bit of your tricep at the same
time
a very very good exercise very
underrated in my opinion in fact i used
to make fun of this exercise all the
time
until i started you know experimenting
with different hsb variations
so that's it that's the list and again
this one is the same as the
uh done by french price no clue why i
have it twice
so let me know what you guys think
that's my list
of best tricep exercises ever vote below
for the next one i believe i haven't
done traps yet i haven't done
biceps and a bunch of other muscles

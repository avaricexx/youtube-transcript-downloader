hey guys what's going on megan here so
east africans
are such a small percentage of the world
population yet they dominate over 90
of long distance events in fact they
have over 90 percent of
world records specifically kenyans and
also ethiopia and surrounding countries
well why is that let's find out
all right so obviously this is fun fact
friday um the previous episodes were on
strongman competitors while the majority
of them are european mostly nordics
then i did one on blacks why they
dominate most fast twitch based
uh sports such as bodybuilding and
sprinting
uh another one on samoans um and pacific
islanders and the dominance in rugby and
what they're overrepresented in the nfl
as a percentage of the population of
course and the most recent one was on
uh mexicans hispanics latinos and why
they dominate
uh lightweight boxing so if you haven't
seen those yet check them out
and as always the disclaimer i'm tired
of repeating this [ __ ] but i have to put
it in all my videos because
there's always this one [ __ ] in the
comment section that gets about her so
first of all this video is not for
everybody um you gotta have a sense of
humor you gotta have thick skin you
gotta be open-minded
um and you gotta be uh pretty much fact
based right
this video is not for people who are
sensitive too serious and are very
close-minded right especially not
you victim mindset [ __ ] right
so the social justice warriors the
marxists
all you guys would get but hurt every
time you hear a raise so every time you
hear
um anything about the difference between
people get lost right this video is not
for you i said it's every [ __ ] time
but yet i still see you in the comment
section you guys don't understand how
much i can't stand this society man
everyone gets per hurt i mean everyone
over every
little thing so once again i'm just
gonna skip your comments if i see you in
the comment section
so again if you're one of those
[ __ ] just dislike the video
then eat [ __ ] and die all right so
remember whenever i mention race or
populations guys i'm just referring to
different groups of people right
we all related right we all came from
the same [ __ ] ancestors somewhere in
east africa
and we migrated to the rest of the world
right some went on and colonized europe
middle east you got my indian
[ __ ] here you got the asians
you got the australians
you got the norfolk south americans and
you got the [ __ ] um
excuse [ __ ] and [ __ ] right so
we all the same
okay from the same family we just look
different
and we have different characteristics
based on the different
environments we evolved in it's fine
it's just natural selection right that
doesn't mean one race is superior
that doesn't mean one group of people
are superior just means we all adapted
to our environments
right and once again these are all the
different environments that we had to
adapt to
desert tundra grassland you know all
this [ __ ] right so you can't tell me
that humans are gonna
you know travel the globe adapt to
vastly different climates and all come
up
looking the same right it's just not
gonna happen right so that's why we have
different
features that's why you know we have
some have white skin obviously for
vitamin d absorption
in the north some have darker skin wide
noses flat noses
uh [ __ ] you name it right we all have
our own adaptations our own superpowers
in fact like i said eventually once i
have time i'm gonna make a video where i
show you guys
all the different adaptations that
happen throughout the globe right i know
every single one of them you guys know
i'm gonna know when it comes to
[ __ ] like this i love studying cultures
different people i get excited about
this [ __ ] so
again when i have time i'll make one
right like a massive
uh super power video all right i'm gonna
skip the natural selection slides i got
to put these on every time because like
i said there's always new viewers
but long story short again bringing out
the
microsoft paint ghetto skills in order
for you to understand the reasons behind
our differences you gotta understand
natural selection right so obviously in
this example
you could tell who's gonna survive on
the left side right obviously the green
mice because they're better camouflaged
he's gonna get his [ __ ] snapped up he's
gonna get [ __ ] snapped up he's gonna get
you snapped alright
whereas on the right side is complete
opposite right these guys are gonna
survive these guys are gonna get [ __ ]
up right
again natural selection right because
they're better camouflaged it has
nothing to do with
oh i'm better than you because i'm red
i'm better you know it's not right so
all you race baiters out there
black or white sick of both of y'all
differences in populations are mainly
due
to who gets to survive and who gets to
clap the most sheets that's it
right same thing with birdman and
islands rule right
in the north where it's colder you're
gonna have you know these animals are
gonna have thicker fur they're gonna
have
shorter extremities and they're gonna be
starkier whereas where it's very hot and
sunny especially in the lower latitudes
you're going to have the exact same
exact same animal right
but you're going to have longer ears
longer limbs and a more slender body we
see this all throughout nature right
and it also applies to humans there's a
reason why people in the north
where it's freezing cold look vastly
different than the people who are near
the equator or live in the tropical
forest and obviously same slide from the
previous video
you guys already know the deal right
this reason why this gorilla is going to
be bigger than the ones living here
because you have limited resources here
and you have a [ __ ] predator right so
he's going to be the one clipping the
tricks on this island
whereas these guys don't need to compete
as much because again you know plenty
you know plenty of resources
you know no predators so the females
have a lot of choice whereas here he's
just going to bully all the small guys
right
so the gorillas here are going to be a
lot bigger because obviously you have to
be a lot bigger to
hog the resources and fight off the
predators whereas here you know
there's no main um there's no main
pressure for increased muscle mass so
increase size
all right so back to the east africans
right and again like i said east africa
mainly kenya but also the surrounding
countries right ethiopia
sudan stuff like that um but why do they
dominate the long distance scene so
[ __ ] much to give you some crazy
perspective some crazy stats
the top 25 best times right for the
marathon
are from east africa that is insane guys
mainly from ethiopia and kenya right
small percentage of the world power and
keep in mind this is not one of those or
maybe they're the only ones doing it
[ __ ] no marathon is
worldwide every country that's true in
fact it was mainly a western event right
mainly a western sport
i mean the name is marathon right greek
origin but these guys have the top 20 so
they have a hundred percent so
go online and look at the top 25 best
marathon tops all east african that's
not a coincidence
even if you look at the 3 000 meters 19
of the last 25 winners
top 25 world record for the 3000 meters
19 out of the 25 east africans and what
makes it even crazy
is that they're mainly from the trial
right the calendar tribe
right so it's not just all kenyans or
all east africans right it's
mainly the small ass drop right so
they're less than 0.06 percent of the
world population
which is ridiculous right they're only
like 10 percent of kenya
right and they make up over 70 of the
winners so
obviously it's a genetic thing right
because if it wasn't then it'll be all
kenyans all east africans it's a
very very very small tribe all right so
once again this is the map of almost all
the different populations on the planet
and again the winners are right here
right now what makes these guys so
special obviously
we know it's not just poverty right it's
not like oh well i have to run to make
money because again there's a lot of
poor reaches in the world
and they don't produce um they don't
dominate long distances running some say
it was because
selective reading wrong the atlantic
slave trade was mainly west africans not
east africans and as i mentioned in my
previous videos
once the human genome project was
complete the whole selective breeding
myth was
absolutely destroyed because they
actually found out that the opposite
stance meaning
people who are actually never part of
the atlantic slave trade so the
west africans who actually never left
actually have a better
fast twitch and muscle building profile
than african americans
and i would explain the reason why it's
mainly due to malaria and stuff like
that but anyway i'll go into more detail
in the black genetics video
some say well it's because they used to
run to school since they were kids wrong
because almost
all the poor people in east africa and
kenya and all that
also run to school or walk to school
since they were little yet only a very
small tribe
dominates uh long distance running and
in fact a lot of the world champions
grew up right next to the [ __ ]
school some say well maybe it's because
they're in africa and they used to
[ __ ] run around and [ __ ]
and chase animals which obviously makes
no [ __ ] sense because then
the majority of the african tribes will
have that advantage when they don't it's
clearly a very small tribe
um in uh in east africa very small tribe
actually they're only like ten percent
of kenya
so you know how come the other africans
don't have that advantage
some say oh maybe it's because they just
have a lot of slow twist muscles which
they do but again
keep in mind every all marathon runners
are slow to
dominate so that's not the reason so
what's the main reason
well number one it's very simple number
one first of all you understand these
guys have
longer legs which obviously gives you an
advantage running they have skinnier
legs
keep in mind when i say longer legs
relative to their toes relative to their
body
skin your legs the legs are lighter for
those of you who don't know
the heavier legs the legs are lighter
and weigh much less which obviously
makes running a lot more efficient
and here's a big one here they have very
very long achilles tendons right so
running running for them is pretty much
like a spring right whereas most people
have to dig into the ground as they're
running these guys are just [ __ ]
hopping about right
very very very great combination for
running on top of the fact that they
have narrower hips
right which most black people have again
that's back to what i mentioned earlier
with natural selection right
allen and bergman's rule kicks in um
they have lesser or body mass and
obviously a higher center of gravity
right so all these things combine
to make them the perfect [ __ ] runners
and there's this picture that i found
online
whereas this guy was comparing his cavs
to east african run
look at the difference in cab insertions
look at the difference look how long the
[ __ ] achilles standards are compared
to
the other guy who has massive calves but
that are obviously horrible for long
distance running
it's just more metabolic efficient to
run when you have these features keep in
mind these guys are running for [ __ ]
hours now once again that doesn't mean
that you're not going to find an
you know a white person or an asian
person where you know
that kind of phenotype it just means a
lot more of them are concentrated in
east africa
all right next reason number two high
altitude i'm mentioning them in the
video on boxes right
these guys live at high altitude you
know as high as seven to ten thousand
feet which obviously anyone who knows a
thing or two about
uh physiology knows the effects that how
altitude has on you on endurance in fact
that's the reason why a lot of
athletes go to train at high altitude to
have to gain an advantage in their
competitions well these guys
live there they live there they train
there to sleep and they've lived there
for centuries after centuries right
so they are very adapted to high
altitude high red blood cells
high hemoglobin higher vo2 max in fact
that's the reason why that one tribe has
an advantage over the rest of kenya even
though they're all in [ __ ] canyon
right because that one tribe actually
lives at a much higher altitude so it's
a combination of all these factors right
you can't just have not only to have
the perfect body for running but they
also have
the perfect high altitude adaptations
next the actin in three gene which i
mentioned previously right
now again this should show you how lucky
these guys are
most people that are enduring space
actually have the xx version uh the
shitty version of the x-men three gene
i'm not gonna explain it again because i
explained it in almost every [ __ ]
video but pretty much if you have the rr
version your body makes acting three
it's a protein that's in your fastest
muscles and it makes your fastest
muscles
stronger that's gonna produce more force
you can recover faster from training
now even though running is mostly slow
twitch baseboard
remember these guys are actually doing
long distance running in a time so
there's also an element of speed
so your fastest muscles do come in to an
extent
and sure enough look where east africans
are when it comes to
actin and three genetic profile i mean
look at this this is insane
90 of them have the good version not the
shitty version the good version
of the acting as you can see here you
know west africans
so people have another part of the slave
trade
um have the highest actually have
jamaicans next you have
african-americans and then the rest of
the world right and east africans are
here
whereas most of the competition in long
distance running
um have the xx version right so they
have an advantage
even on the fastest muscles which is an
insane insane combination for running
lighter body high altitude adaptations
plus a preferential accidentally profile
insane
reason number four the calendar again
back to the one small tribe that
dominates all these running events
these guys have a huge history of being
cattle raiders for those of you who
don't know
cattle was a huge huge huge part of
these guys lives right
your wealth was pretty much measured by
how much calorie you own same thing with
them you know the other tribes the
messiah tribes and stuff and stuff like
that
and these guys were counterattacks right
so they will run for miles at a time
right they were usually started at night
where they would run for miles at a time
up to 100 miles sometimes
they would go to the neighboring tribes
steal the [ __ ] cattle
and bring it all back right so they had
to do this at blazing speed can you
imagine
running at night for miles at a time
finding the other tribe's cattle and
having to bring it all the way back to
your drive
without getting caught you had to have
insane endurance
to pull that feet off and sure enough
natural selection kicks in right because
obviously the ones who are
better adapted to that kind of uh
lifestyle other ones are going to bring
back the cattle
increase their status have the most
wives clap the most cheeks and have the
most kids right
yeah that's how it works so not only
they had all these crazy adaptations
but then you add the natural selection
um from again the whole cattle rating on
top of that and it's funny because even
the other tribes in east africa who are
also very good runners
also have a history of cataracting right
so again so it's not a random
[ __ ] theory out there and last but
not least you gotta look at cultural
factors that i mentioned almost every
video right pressure from other sports
is another reason why they're dominating
running because again you're not going
to see them
in the nfl right the nfl is dominated by
populations that have
higher muscle mass such as northern
europeans and west african descendants
right african-americans
you're not going to see them you know
doing strongmen right that's just
dominated by the nordics right
and also the east europeans you're not
going to see them in you know
well they do play soccer right but again
soccer is dominated mainly by hispanics
who also dominate you know lightweight
boxing basketball
dominated by eastern europeans and
obviously african americans or west
african descendants
so again you're not going to see um a
lot of ethiopians and kenyans and you
know
tanzanians here there's some exceptions
of course such as minoubo tall ass
[ __ ]
weightlifting again dominated by eastern
europeans and
asians and you damn sure not gonna see
them in [ __ ] rugby right samoans have
that [ __ ] on lock right
so that leads very little sports right
for east africans which pretty much
soccer and obviously endurance running
but this is where they really shine
right so you have to look at cultural
factors as well right let's say so those
are the top five reasons
one you have the fact that they have the
perfect [ __ ] anatomy for running
two they don't have the shitty version
of the actin and three gene
which the competition definitely has so
even though long distance running is a
slow twitch dominant sport you still
have a speed element to it and that's
where the actin and three gene comes in
next you have the fact that they live
literally at high altitude for
centuries four you have the tradition of
cataracting which obviously
further selects the best of the best
runners and allows them to pass on their
genes
and last but not least as i just
mentioned there's not as much pressure
on from other sports right the different
races and populations just
dominate all the other niches all right
i say guys when i have time i'm going to
make another one
uh in the coming weeks on let's see i
haven't done wrestling right europeans
dominate wrestling i want to mention why
um as well as this
dominate weightlifting right like i
mentioned earlier so i'm gonna make a
video probably on that
um what else does the iq video that's
gonna trigger a lot of [ __ ] people
but i'm gonna make anyway
and let's see we'll see we'll see again
just comment below
i'm gonna make a whole list of all the
different adaptations and make a video

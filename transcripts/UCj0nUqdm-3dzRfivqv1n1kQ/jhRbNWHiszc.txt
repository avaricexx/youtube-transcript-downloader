hey guys what's going on megan here all
right so check out the results from
various studies
each ball represents a study on the
effect of a certain something
on myostatin right so each ball
represents a reduction in myosatin from
the lowest to the highest right
you could tell that the average around
40 percent as low as 20 percent
as high as you know 75 80 percent right
and look how effective all of these
methods are
at reducing myostatin now i guess guess
what method or supplement or whatever it
is
uh that resulted in this huge decrease
in my statin right guess what the
meister and blockers
in these respective studies wear
anyway this is another episode of my
style monday i decided to bring the
series back
now i'm pretty sure everyone is already
familiar with my satin
you guys already know how obsessed i am
with that molecule
there are three molecules that i'm
obsessed with that i've spent over a
decade researching and it's obviously
testosterone
dopamine and myostatin so those three
are my babies and i love keeping up with
the research on my style and again you
guys know how pretrophy is my obsession
this is my handmade
uh don't even try to make sense out of
this you know this is uh
something i created on powerpoint pretty
much ever i mapped out every single
pathway of hypertrophy
every single pathway you could think
about from the engineering receptor
estrogen receptor igf-1 pathway whatever
i've seen my status here even like this
throwing this up here
so as you can tell i'm very obsessed
with this [ __ ] and i understand this
pathway like the back of my [ __ ] hand
and in case you were wondering out of
all of these different pathways the most
anabolic one
is the mystery pathway right again that
includes the active n2b receptor activan
a
phylostatins mad you name it it is the
most
anabolic pathway muscle building pathway
in the human body it's even more
antibiotic than the testosterone
and androgen receptor pathway believe it
or not people actually think that
the androgen receptor pathway or pretty
much you know steroids
uh are more anabolic than the mass time
effort which is not the case in fact if
you have
to choose between being born with a mild
stand efficiency
or being born with uh over expressing
the energy receptor
you definitely want to pick the
myostatin efficiency pathway you'd be a
lot bigger in fact
every single animal or human that has uh
my sound efficiency
from birth are way bigger than it would
have been if they're on steroids
keep in mind you know all these uh
examples here that have normal levels of
testosterone in their bodies so they're
able to get this jacked
without excess amounts of testosterone
which goes to show how
powerful the myostatin pathway is and
again it's this pathway here
now the reason why it's so anabolic is
simple one
my stance stops protein synthesis so
obviously
blocking my statin is going to increase
protein synthesis
myself increases protein breakdown so it
does many things at once
not only decreases protein synthesis but
it also increases the protein breakdown
so
by stopping my statin you're actually
getting double the effect on hypertrophy
third thing it does is obviously stop
satellite cell activation so go buy a
nuclear silver load
goodbye satellite sub proliferation and
all that good [ __ ]
and on top of that my stat is
responsible for insulin resistance
so if you're obese or if you borderline
have type 2 diabetes
my stand is to blame so by stopping this
protein by stopping this molecule
and this pathway you are actually
hitting four birds
with one stone that's why animals or
humans who like the myself and protein
are so jacked it's a quadruple effect
and there are even more pathways that i
could cover in future videos and that's
also why
people who have high myostatin levels
lose muscle extremely fast
for example whenever you put your legs
in the cast or whenever you immobilized
the reason why your legs shrink is
because your levels of myostatin in your
leg
increase hiv patients and people who are
wasting away
the main reason why they lose so much
muscle is because their my style levels
go up astronauts right the reason why
now astronauts have to actually train in
space is because the moment they go
in space where there's no gravity no
tension or volume on the muscle
my station levels go up and they lose a
ton of muscle mass so as you can see the
meister and pathway is no joke it is by
far the most important pathway
even with anabolic steroids when
bodybuilders get on anabolic steroids
and put on muscle
yes in some cases my stand goes up so
obviously keep up with the huge increase
of muscle mass
but phallus starting goes up even more
which is the reason why they have this
huge
increase in uh in muscle mass right most
people don't know that
most of testosterone's anabolic effects
are mainly mediated
uh by the phylostatin pathway black
phyllostatin and testosterone pretty
much loses a ton of his potency but
anyway that's a whole different topic
for all different video
now did you guess what the mystery
method was
that lowered my statin so drastically in
all these studies
boom resistance training guys the number
one milestone blocker in the world
based on the research we have so far the
number one natural milestone blocker is
training resistance training can lower
my satin
up to 70 usually about 40 on average
that is
a bigger reduction than you get from
anything else that's out there in the
market
right you guys doing this channel i like
to stick with the basics right stop
trying to spend your money on all these
different supplements
that promise you things that the basics
take care of you know that's why i
emphasize basic things like
drinking water sleeping getting enough
sunlight and vitamin d
eating your spinach and quinoa right
save your money especially when natural
means are so much more effective
everyone is out there asking me meegan
what do you think of this uh my
sandblocker and his father
when you could just [ __ ] train right
nothing
that we know of so far naturally that is
reduces my stand more than training in
fact the reason why you build muscle
from lifting weights in the first place
is because
every exercise session every workout
session that you do
lowers my satin and several studies have
shown not only the correlation but the
causation for example this study here
shows you
the coalition is negative 82 so that
means almost 70 percent
of the gains you make from lifting are
due to
your ability to lower my saturn from
each lifting session
think about that for a second that's why
people who are not good at lowering my
asylum from training don't put on games
for example old women it's very hard for
all women to put on muscle because
when all women train it is very hard for
them to lower my side as opposed to old
man or young men and young women
the bigger the drop in my stand from
your lifting sessions
the bigger the hypertrophy over time
right this is a bigger correlation
than the contribution of testosterone to
training let that sink in for a moment
reducing myostatin from training is way
more important
than even increasing uh natural
testosterone from your training sessions
now the reason why you don't look like
this after years of training is simply
because
they had no myosin from birth right the
the belgian blue these my stand
dogs whatever these guys had no my stand
from birth so
not only they had hyperplasia they have
a lot more muscle fibers
but they were under the influence of uh
not having my
saturn for years the perfect example is
these mice here for example this one is
lacking the active and 2b receptor which
is where milestone binds
and this one the biggest one and i'm
going to make a whole separate video on
that
is actually expressing father saturn so
meaning not only is blocking my side
but it's also blocking active in a which
also activates active into b receptor
anyways yes so that's the reason why you
don't look like this just from training
simply because
these guys were under the influence of
uh uh not having my sign for a lot
longer
the second reason is simply because most
people forget that after a lifting
session my standard drops
for a very short amount of time i've
mentioned in past videos right at eight
hours post training is when you have
your biggest drop in my style and then
it goes right back to baseline
around the 24 30 hour mark which again
brings us back to
frequent training nucleus overload full
body workouts
notice how eventually everything boils
back down to simply weekly volume
keeping my statin at bay notice how
before training
it was elevated after training huge drop
and then back to baseline so you have to
keep the cycle going keep training again
obviously assuming you fully recovered
to keep my stand away all right so
that's it guys the number one
meister and blocker in the world is
simply
lifting [ __ ] weights now of course in
the future i'm going to make more videos
on the different
uh my style blockers out there but for

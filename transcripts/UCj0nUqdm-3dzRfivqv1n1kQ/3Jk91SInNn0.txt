hey guys what's going on megan here been
a long time how to take a break as usual
you guys already know the deal when the
stock market is booming
uh i got to take a break and focus on
what pays the bills
youtube is just my passion as you guys
know i do this for fun
so it takes a it takes a back seat you
know when uh when the market is on fire
but anyway so it's the new year i
figured i'd come back with some videos
for y'all why
mexicans today's friday by the way so
we're doing fun fact friday
if you haven't noticed so why are
mexicans so good at fighting right
and when i say mexicans guys i'm
referring to pretty much i'm using
mexicans but it's it includes
you know most of latin america right so
latinos hispanics whatever you want to
call it right
so it's not just mexico that includes uh
the rest of latin america that
includes cuba puerto rico whatever so
pretty much native american descendants
so why they're so good at boxing you
know in case you'd be living under a
rock they have
a huge huge amount of world champions
in boxing of course so the question
arises why you know
now before i get deeper into the video i
have to make a disclaimer every freaking
time because people just don't listen
right so disclaimer this video is not
for everybody guys this video
is for people who have a sense of humor
right pretty much my subscribers right
people who have thick skin who are not
offended by every little detail right
uh people are open-minded curious and
obviously
you know believing facts or feelings
right
i hate this society where people only
agree with facts
when it makes me feel good the moment
the fact makes me feel bad it's like oh
no no no [ __ ] that right sciences
science facts and facts
right so if you're easily butt hurt just
don't watch this video it's not for you
right
and these are the people that don't want
watching this video if you're too
serious you can't laugh you're too
sensitive
you're close-minded uh you have the
victim mindset
social justice warrior [ __ ] just
leave man i do not want you guys in my
comment section
i said it last time in the last video
and i still saw you in my comment
section so just dislike the video
and get lost now back to the actual
topic
first let's get this out of the way
right race does exist
okay yes we're part of the um you know
we're part of the human species
we you know we one big [ __ ] family
but we have our differences as you can
clearly [ __ ] tell that's why you can
send your spit
a blood sample over to a company and
they can tell what race you are
without even looking at you people can
look at your dna and say
okay you asian you're african you're
european whatever right so we have our
differences
and there's nothing wrong with that
right there's nothing wrong with race
there's nothing wrong with
population ethnicity whatever you want
to [ __ ] call it right to me i see it
as like a [ __ ] big big ass video game
man i see it as
you know um we all have our perks we
have our strengths we have our
weaknesses you know it's like a big ass
rpg
right even if you look at a family look
at a family of white people a family of
black people or whatever
even within the family there are
differences some are taller some are
shorter
some are smarter you know their
differences
so what in the hell is it not okay to
understand that there are differences
between people who are not even
not only the nonprofits and family but
they're [ __ ] evolved
in completely different parts of the
world different biomes
different climates come on guys right so
for the record
yes when i when i'm sick when i say race
or ethnicity
i'm referring to different populations
who've adapted
in uh different parts of the world right
so i don't see my conversation
dudes news thing is great shut up all
right
all right and again you know before i go
further to the video there goes my
[ __ ] bootleg microsoft paint drawings
to illustrate natural selection for
those of you guys who skip biology
natural selection is simple guys it
affects not just animals but it affected
our human
development as humans as well in this
example here
right obviously this is made up right i
just drew this real fast just to prove
my point
which mouse do you think is gonna
survive on the left obviously the green
mice right because they they blend in
better right they're not gonna get this
[ __ ] snapped up
he's gonna die he's gonna die he's gonna
die right so when you come in the future
and you see there's a bunch of green
mice here that doesn't mean that the
green monster just better or more
superior it just means that
better adapted to the environment that's
it right
same thing on this side right here the
green mats are going to [ __ ] die
right so that's the way i see
differences between races and between
populations right
don't get bar hard over it it's just
natural selection another example is
here obviously if you live in the north
higher latitude
you're going to be thicker bigger
stockier right because the bargains rule
if you live
at lower latitudes where it's obviously
hot as [ __ ]
close to the equator you're obviously
going to have you know lengthier body
smaller body longer extremities and
things that you know on and so forth
that doesn't mean that this one is
better than this one right they're just
better adapted to the environment
bergman and allen's rule
right lastly why is this gorilla on this
side of the lake bigger than this one
simple right here you obviously have a
[ __ ] predator look at this ugly ass
cheetah i drew here or leopard where the
[ __ ] that is right
and there's obviously less resources and
sure enough when you look in
the animal kingdom wherever you have
predators and lower resources
males are bigger they have to compete
for females right whereas here
when there's no predators resources are
abundant the sexual dimorphism is not as
big
right right so this [ __ ] is gonna pass
on his genes easily right
there's no competition his kid's gonna
come out looking like him and this big
ass guy's gonna pass on his soul-ass
jeans right it's just natural selection
guys all right
so let's move on now and by the way this
is a quick uh powerpoint slide that i
put together just to show you guys
you know all the different adaptations
that humans were into throughout the
globe
all the different ones i don't have time
to go over to go over this right now
because if it's going to be too [ __ ]
long
um but if you want i could make a video
on this on one of the future
fun fact fridays hey i'm going to go
ahead and explain all the different
adaptations
asians africans east west indians
you know you name it anyway all right so
back to the video so first reason number
one reason number one why mexicans
are so good at boxing number one is
obviously genes as always it's always a
combination of genes
and the environment right genes and
cultures and environment nature nurture
[ __ ] right
uh in the black video with jeans and
obviously the environment i mentioned
malaria and all that stuff in the white
video
uh the the video on strongman i
mentioned obviously jeans which is
superior height larger frame
and obviously the environment which is
again protein access to
you know and all those other things so
you always have a combination of both
right the question is how much does each
contribute
so first is endurance right you gotta
say guys
boxing is very very endurance-based and
a lot of people who
have no experience with boxing think
that it's just fast switch muscles and a
lot of
uh big muscled up [ __ ] no
there's a lot
a lot of endurance that goes into boxing
right and and you got to be able to make
it past the first few rounds especially
if you're doing um the lighter ways keep
in mind this video is not about like
heavyweight boxing i mean many sort of
my middleweight lightweight and stuff
like that right
um this is where uh you know mexicans
and hispanics dominate
on a genetic level uh they're pretty
much on the other side of the extreme
when it comes to fast and slow twist
muscles right
again blacks are the most fastest
dominant people on the planet
uh when i say blacks i mean west african
descendants if you haven't watched my
video go check it out i'm gonna skip a
lot of details to keep this video short
but they have the most the biggest
percentage of fastest muscles
so very good for speed very good for
power um
very good for jumping and you know
building muscle all the things that have
to do with phasors muscles
west african descent is obviously going
to dominate and i explain why you know
it's mainly because of malaria and a
bunch of other [ __ ]
whereas slow twitch dominant muscles
obviously going to give you an advantage
in endurance sports so marathon running
uh um obviously boxing like i just
mentioned uh and of course
you know um hispanics and latinos are on
the completely opposite end especially
uh pretty much asians and latinos right
east africans as well
they're on the completely opposite end
of the spectrum when it comes to slow
twitch muscles
they're very very slow towards dominant
which gives them a huge advantage in
enduring sports
here are some genes that come into play
for example the actin and three gene
which i covered in the previous video
and the one on
um black genetics uh is again it's found
in your fat switch muscles if you have
if you make the
actin 3 protein you actually have
stronger phase muscles it's going to
recover better from workouts
pretty much it gives you an edge when it
comes to uh you know power
and again you have two alleles you know
the axilla which means your body does
not make enough
actin and three especially if you have
xx right because you get one for me my
home from your dad
and you have the rr allele right if you
have the r then your body makes a ton
of [ __ ] acting dude of course west
africans um and that descendants
have the most the highest frequency of
all it's like 99 to 100
which is insane in fact the ones in west
africa actually have even more
than the african-americans in america
which again slaps the whole
stupid-ass selective breeding theory out
of the park
right it's mainly because of malaria
mexico is on the other end
of the most xx um dominant group on the
planet right so
very very slow twitch dominant again the
ace gene
i made videos about that black some more
dd which can give them an advantage in
power sports
and again hispanics are more ii
the ppar alpha gene same thing black
some more cc
which gives them an advantage in power
sports hispanics are more gg
the ckmg which are pretty much creating
kidneys um black sumo gg which gives
them an advantage in you know again
power sports
and latinos are more a and also blacks
also have the highest myostatin
mutations funny people think it's
actually europeans actually if you look
at the studies actually where
sub-saharan africans they have the
biggest
um the highest frequencies of my stand
um mutations
which is one of the reasons why they put
on muscles so [ __ ] fast and lastly
they also have a very
very sensitive androgen receptor you
know again which one reason why they
respond so well to steroids in the
bodybuilding scene
um and and the downside of that is this
is also why they're you know
um at the biggest risk of prostate
cancer for those who don't know blacks
are [ __ ] when it comes to prostate
cancer because the androgen receptor are
just way too sensitive
and they have way too many receptor
mutations um
which again it's a good thing when
trying to build muscle it's bad when you
know you're dealing with prostate cancer
now when it comes to
hispanics another benefit that they have
is again especially mexicans and south
south americans high altitude right
people forget that
training at high altitude or living in
high altitude gives you a huge advantage
when it comes to enduring sports right
in fact that's why a lot of athletes
actually go
to training high altitudes before you
know when they're trying to get ready
for their respective races or whatever
because it gives you a huge advantage
you know
the body has different ways of you know
adapting either by increasing your red
blood cells your hemoglobin
things of that nature whereas these
[ __ ] just live there right so
they've adapted to that to that
environment for a very long time you
know even in mexico the altitude
in some places is as high as like seven
thousand feet or even higher which is
way higher than even denver
so they pretty much have the the you
know the added benefit
of the high altitude same thing with
canyons and um ethiopia and what is so
good at marathon running
which i could make a video about that if
you guys want but altitude plays a huge
role as well they also live
at very high altitudes and lastly a lot
of people forget about this
uh hispanics have some of the lowest and
i mean the lowest
frequencies of the apo e4 right looking
for those who don't know
if you have the e4 little it increases
your chances of alzheimer's
and it pretty much increases your
chances of um
brain damage in fact it's harder for you
to recover from brain damage
if you have the e4 lead right and um
i think the studies show like i think
it's up to six times worse
so if you get hit in the head whether by
playing football or boxing um
and you have the e4 a little you are
[ __ ] right it takes a lot longer for
your brain to recover
and for most people that you don't even
make it um and sure enough
mexican americans hispanics latinos
you know the whole south american
population they have the lowest
frequency of this
of this which is amazing you know this
is perfect for boxing so as you can see
this is a huge
huge genetic component remember sports
performance is 65 to 70 genetics right
we've proven that so you got to look at
genes first
right so don't think muscle is
everything guys when it comes to boxing
endurance is extremely important keep in
mind guys back when this fight happened
years ago
they were around the same weight right
around the same way obviously in the
same way class
this guy looks a lot more jacked but
guess who want to fight right so do not
think that just because you have big
muscles it means you could win every
[ __ ] fight no no a skinny max again
will
beat the [ __ ] out of your jacked ass if
you don't come correct
next is obviously height you know height
is always going to come into play just
like it did in a strong man video and
i'm
i'm obviously trolling with this picture
guys i know this is not boxing this is
rey mysterio and greg ali
but i have to say that i'm trolling
because someone is going to go in the
conversation and be like
this is wrong this is not boxing we know
we know
right laugh all right so
uh height plays a huge role right again
if you uh if you yeah if you're a taller
boxer you have some advantages mainly
you have a longer reach
but there are a lot more advantages to
being a showboxer one your center of
gravity is a lot lower which is
extremely important for obviously
balance
movement uh energy efficiency it's a lot
easier to bob and weave it's a lot
easier to get close to your point it's
pretty much
once you get past your the taller
opponent's long reach he's [ __ ] right
because if you're shorter
you obviously can you know throw in more
hits you can give a lot more body shots
you can generate way more power in your
body shots especially trying to hit that
lever
also smaller target i mean there are so
many benefits to being a shorter boxer
so many the only downside is just the
reach and obviously the fact that
you know a taller boxer can hit way more
angles than you can you know
obviously downward but for the most part
a lot more benefits to being a shoulder
boxer
especially if you learn to use at the
advantage and sure enough
you can see here these are the um
tallest and shortest countries obviously
the tallest ones are darker green or
whatever the [ __ ] this doodle color is
and as you can tell south america and
mexico and the rest are down and if you
look at the height chart
right the average height in mexico is
about five six right so they're between
this guy and this guy right so between
rey mysterio i think let me say it was
like five six
and obviously had to give a rest in
peace by the way guys this is like my
childhood right here you know you got
some a big wrestling fan well i was a
wrestling fan growing up now it's full
of [ __ ]
um but um my childhood was destroyed
when he died but anyway yeah so
mexicans are usually here right between
five six
five six and five seven right which is a
great population of pull
uh boxes from especially in uh you know
lighter weight divisions third reason is
obviously
pressure from other sports just like i
mentioned in the strongman video right
you're not gonna see you know again
because of the anatomy their body type
you're not gonna see a lot of mexicans
in
american football i mean let's look at
all the major sports on the american
continent right so you have football you
have basketball you have
baseball you have soccer um boxing
stuff like that right you're not gonna
see them in [ __ ] football right
because again that's dominated by mainly
you know whites blacks and samoans right
system ones but i should say polynesians
you know
uh pacific islanders right uh most of
the linebacker positions most of the
um tight end positions most of the
defensive backs positions
are mainly you know wise and samoans and
obviously blacks right and of course
most of the running backs cornerbacks
the fastest positions in football are
dominated by blacks right it's not even
close right because of what i mentioned
earlier about the whole faster stuff so
these three races or populations or
whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it
right
dominate football right um basketball is
obviously dominated by blacks right
now i'm not saying you're not going to
find any uh
hispanics in those positions i'm just
saying the frequency is going to be low
right because there's always somebody in
the comment section that's gonna pull
out one random outlier
and be like well this guy you know it's
kind of like when you talk about smoking
and someone's like
well my grandfather is 94 years old and
he smokes and he's just fine
it's called an outlier [ __ ]
right so stop mentioning outliers i'm
talking about in general
um so you're not going to see a lot of
mexicans in the nfl you know i see a lot
of
uh you know hispanics you know playing
at center shooting guards
power forward small forward you know
stuff like that it's very rare you're
going to find something out of that
so that leaves us with three sports
right soccer
boxing and baseball right and sure
enough they dominate the [ __ ] out of
boxing
right and also again they're also really
good at soccer really good at baseball
but mainly to dominate the [ __ ] out of
boxing reason number four the bloodline
don't forget guys mexicans and south
americans blah blah
these guys come from you know the
kingdoms of old you guys are descendants
of the aztecs
mayans incas you know these guys were
fierce warriors guys
you know kind of like in a strongman
video where i mentioned the vikings and
you know stuff like that
so these guys are not descendants of
just you know uh
quiet peaceful farmers right uh look you
know learn your history
look up some of the [ __ ] these guys used
to do man [ __ ]
insane warrior cultures and violence was
just you know part of everyday life
of course jeans had to do with that
right and on top of that
they went through a bottleneck you know
whenever your population is going
through a bottleneck event
you're gonna come out with some crazy um
adaptations you know the bottleneck
event obviously being
you know when they were conquered you
know when they conquered a lot of them
died a lot of them died from
so many you know illnesses all the germs
that uh the [ __ ] europeans brought
right millions and millions of
natives were wiped out well guess who
survived in fact guess who was
most vulnerable uh you know to die from
those
illnesses whether it was measles
smallpox whatever scientists are still
trying to debate with you know
what the [ __ ] it was but guess who was
those who had weak immune systems those
who were
weak those who already had other
illnesses you know if your immune system
was compromised and you got struggled
one of those you would [ __ ]
so those who survive are not only
descendants of warriors but also people
who actually survived
those who had great immune systems or
you know have some natural mutation that
allowed them to survive those
uh you know those plagues and a lot of
their descendants
alive today in uh in a mexican and rest
of latino population
so very very very good bloodline and as
always that's
i'm not saying every single one of them
um have those uh have that advantage but
the vast majority
last reason is culture right first of
all
mexicans have a great great work ethic i
mean
great i lived in three different
continents guys and i've also visited
and lived in so many states in america
and
most of the mexicans that i met again i
said most not all
not only they were cool as [ __ ] right uh
especially when i know when i lived in
texas for a bit they were so [ __ ]
cool but the work ethic man
of course you're always gonna find some
lazy uh you know within the group but
the majority of them have a sick workout
in fact we even have jokes you know
stand-up comedy and [ __ ] where one is a
work ethic joke people mention asians
and mexicans right these guys work so
[ __ ] hard
so culture plays a huge role you know so
yes
they have a genetic advantage but they
also have you know um you know that will
power that culture
just like i mentioned in the strongman
video are people in over in iceland and
those
freezing ass cold countries you know a
lot of them respect strength you know
and
and hard work and all those things so
that also plays a [ __ ] role right
second thing is they start recruiting
these kids really young you know don't
be surprised if you go to mexico and you
see
a lot of you know eight nine sometimes
even younger kids practicing and getting
ready to
you know to join that lifestyle i don't
remember exactly at what age ryan
started but he started pretty [ __ ]
young as well
right next is also take it out of
poverty you gotta understand guys first
of all boxing is a cheap sport right
um you don't need a lot of money to be a
boxer right so um it's also take it out
of poverty
a lot of these kids they have you know
i'm not saying all of them right
obviously there's some rich places in
mexico and latin america
but um a lot of these kids that's their
only ticket out of poverty right so to
them is do or die
right um it's different than somebody
else who's saying hey i want to box
because it's fun well to a lot of these
kids this
i want to box because you know it's my
way out so that gives them you know
that extra [ __ ] drive when all us
when all else fails
and obviously it's just a big [ __ ]
sport in the country just like i
mentioned in the
uh you know sprinting in jamaica um
strongman and uh strongman competitions
and
northern europe stuff like that it's a
huge sport in mexico right
up there with soccer and baseball so the
people love it it's part of the culture
same reason why in uh in america you
know black kids want to be you know
basketball players or football players
well a lot of the mexican kids that want
to be boxers or soccer players or
baseball players so again it's a huge
sport in the country
and you know that's also one of the
reasons why they take it so seriously
and produce so many champions all right
so that's it guys conclusion
number one they have a very very uh
dominant endurance profile which helps
them a lot in boxing
number two their height right the
average rat is about five six
gives them an advantage as far as center
of gravity speed
uh energy efficiency technique power
things of that nature
number three there's no pressure from
you know the nba doesn't go down to
mexico to recruit right the nfl doesn't
go down
to latin america to say hey you know
let's find some linebackers right
so that also um eliminates a lot of the
options
number four they have a very very strong
bloodline not only being descendants of
you know the great civilizations of old
but obviously
surviving being a descendants of those
who survive so many deadly plagues
and lastly you know again culture it's a
huge part of their culture
it's a nice ticket out of poverty to
start really early
and obviously the mexican work ethic
right the latin american work ethic i
should say all right guys that's it hope
you enjoyed the video
there are obviously a bunch of different
factors but i gotta keep this video
short as possible i gotta focus on the
top five
but comment below let me know what you
guys think let's have a nice
mature hilarious discussion in the
comment section

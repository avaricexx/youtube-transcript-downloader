hey guys what's going on megan here so
here's the video i promise you guys
the famous monkey that was injected with
phylostatin
uh it was a group of monkeys by the way
but anyway this is the control groups
right this is the leg muscle by the way
guys this is the quads
so this is the control group and this is
the leg gains of the monkey that was
injected
with a phylostat virus right check it
out right
and he reached that size in about 12
weeks so in only three months
this monkey got jacked out of his
[ __ ] mind it was only one leg though
they only injected in one leg to see the
effects
nonetheless these are some impressive
gains this is way more muscle
than we see when we inject animals with
ridiculous levels of testosterone
once again just to show you how powerful
phylostatin is
and keep in mind the monkeys were not
exercised this was straight
injection of phyllostat no training no
steroids
nothing but anyway guys this is another
episode of my statin monday where we
talk about everything related to
myostatin
which is the most important molecule
when it comes to muscle growth
yes even more important and testosterone
and for those who don't know what
myostatin
does let's do a quick recap for those
who know you could just skip to the next
chapter because this is going to be
repetitive and [ __ ] for you
right so long story short my statin is a
gene it's a protein that your body makes
and its job is pretty much the limit how
much muscle you could put on right if it
wasn't for myostatin it will all walk
around like the [ __ ] hook right
so it does four main things it stops
protein synthesis
it increases protein breakdown it lowers
satellite cell activation
and it makes you insulin resistant which
obviously leads to
less muscle more fat so pretty much it
makes your skinny fat
phylostatin on the other hand it's
another protein that your body makes
and it does the opposite of myostatin
right it stops myostatin
from activating its effects to its
receptor it also stops active in a
so this is the most anabolic molecule in
the human body
phylostatin even more anabolic than
testosterone in fact testosterone's
effects are mainly mediated through
phallistide
here are some examples of what happens
when your myostatin levels are too high
for example the reason why your legs
shrink when you put them in a cast so
you
immobilize for a long time is because
myostatin levels go up
the reason why hiv and cancer patients
lose a ton of muscle so
fast is also because the myostatin
levels go up
and the reason why astronauts lose a ton
of muscle mass in space is because once
again when you go into space in a low
gravity environment
my stand also goes up right so my stand
is the bad guy
if your goal is to maximize muscle
growth here's an example of a rat at the
bottom here this is the control right
this is a normal ride
and this is the rat that was genetically
engineered to overproduce phylostatin
and to also lack the myostatin gene
so as you can see that's the biggest rat
we've seen in in research
four times the amount of muscle as a
regular at
right so and once again normal levels of
testosterone
normal levels of androgens it is so
massive
it's not even funny and here's what the
rat looks like
when it's actually alive straight braley
dwarfing the other rat and this is lean
muscle as well extremely low levels of
body fat
this is the monkey that was injected
with father stein which is what we're
going to cover in today's video
as you can see here this is before the
injection this is only a few weeks after
the injection about three months after
the injection
absurd amounts of muscle growth and this
is the 10 year old kid who was lucky
enough to be born with a myostatin
efficiency
once again he has normal levels of
testosterone completely natty
but look at his physique at 10 years old
right
his parents were freaked out they
brought him to the doctor and yeah his
he's healthy perfectly healthy normal
levels of androgens didn't even go
through puberty
yet yeah he has more muscle than the
average grown ass man
once again this is what happens when
you're lacking myosin or you over
producing phylostat
and again the reason why professional
bodybuilders look so [ __ ] huge is
because
one of the main effects of testosterone
is to interfere with the master and
pathway
mainly by up regulating phallus statin
or increasing the activity of the rgf1
pathway
several studies also back this up as you
can see here one of the most important
transcription factors in fact
the most important transcription factor
for muscle growth is accurate one
you can see here the correlation is
0.999 which is
in short the most important
transcription factor for hypertrophy
and sure enough my satin blocks this
gene
so you want to put on gains you have to
down regulate mice that you have to
lower match that
now the study shows the same thing the
correlation with the amount of gains you
put on after training
and your ability to lower my statin is
negative point
82 which is massive my statin is also
the reason why old women put on a lot
less muscle than young men
or old man after training mainly because
they have a hard time lowering my statin
even when they train as you can see here
old man have a big drop in my stand
after training
young men have the biggest drop in mind
starting after training which is why
again young man put on muscle so fast
young women decent drop but old women
struggle
to lower myostatin which is why they
struggle to put on muscle mass
and several other studies confirm this
as you can see here
one of the main reasons why women cannot
get as big as men
even if you inject them with
testosterone is because the myostatin
activity is way too
high myostatin is also responsible for
insulin resistance so if you have a dead
bod
you skinny fat you have that tire around
your belly well
chances are you have very high levels of
myostatin next myostatin is also the
reason why those were trained with full
body workouts so with high frequency
tend to put on muscles so fast
because the dropping mice and after
training only lasts for less than a day
right
the drive peaks at the eight hour mark
and then slowly after that myerstein
goes back to baseline right it goes
right back to [ __ ] up your gains
so that's why those who train more
frequently just full body workouts
nucleus overload
tana put on muscles so fast right
they're constantly keeping my stat and
down regulated smile status is also the
reason why
people will supplement with creatine
tend to put on more muscle it's not just
the other effects of creatine it's
mainly that
creatine also is a very very powerful
myostatin blocker as you can see here
this is the drop in my style from the
group that trained with our creatine and
this is the dropping margin
from the group that trained with
creatine huge drop
and lastly that's the reason why the
world anti-doping agency
ban every single agent that
drastically blocks my stats or increases
file style
but if you want to lower my stand you're
gonna have to do it naturally and i have
a ton of videos on that i just watched
the playlist
all right so back to the study it's
called philosophy and delivery enhances
muscle growth and strength and non-human
primates i'm gonna put the link in the
description so you guys can check it out
but long story short here's the result
right there goes the control group that
goes uh you could skip the middle one
right they interacted it with a
different they were pretty much trying
out two different
kinds of the virus and the middle one
was trash so let's focus on
cmvfs so as you can see
the timeline of gains from week zero all
the way to week 20
the blue line is the control group
obviously no gains
the green line is once again the weaker
version
so let's focus on the red line as you
can see a 15 plus percent gain
in muscle growth in only 12 weeks after
the 12-week mark
as you know this thing started to kind
of plateau so in 12 weeks
in three months this is how much muscle
that monkey was able to build without
training you can't even see these
results
in that time span with deca trend dyna
ball
or any other steroids or even peptides
that are out there
now keep in mind this is not realistic
in real life right because these monkeys
were injected
with a genetically engineered virus that
makes your body overproduce phytostatin
you know in fact remember these guys
this study was not done for bodybuilding
right
these guys are trying to find remedies
for people who are suffering with muscle
wasting diseases right so
but as like in all things eventually
bodybuilders are going to get their
hands on stuff like that right it's just
like steroids yeah steroids were not
invented for bodybuilders right they
were invented for patients burn patients
cancer patients and then bodybuilders
were like wait a minute you know
let me hop on that right so it's just a
matter of time
right until eventually ibb pros hop on
stuff like that if they're not already
doing it already they're probably doing
it in the middle east already or in
russia or some [ __ ] right because these
guys are the early adopters
but yeah guys gene therapy is the future
it's the future of bodybuilding
obviously not natural bodybuilding all
right we natty so we obviously staying
away from stuff like that but
as far as rpg bodybuilding goes gene
therapy is the future right
it's going to take over bodybuilding
it's going to take over the olympics
right because think about it right if
this monkey was able to put on that much
muscle without the risks that come with
steroid use
right and they also checked those levels
right the testosterone levels were
normal
no heart problems nothing right so once
bodybuilders realize that they're able
to put on so much muscle
without the risks that come with
testosterone use
right no worries about liver toxicity
not having to worry about balding acne
dyno none of that [ __ ] they're gonna hop
on that like crazy
it's just a matter of time now as far as
us naturals the best thing we could do
is just
lower my style and increase file styling
through training
because obviously once these things
become common if you inject the
phallistic producing virus in your body
you're no longer natty that that goes
without saying oh by the way and there
goes the table where to show you the
testosterone levels as you can see
testosterone levels were the same right
so much muscle without even
using the testosterone and androgen
receptor pathway which is insane
which once again goes to show how
powerful
the my stanford style impactful is but
anyway guys didn't want to make this
video too long

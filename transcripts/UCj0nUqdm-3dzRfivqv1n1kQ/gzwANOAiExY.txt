guys what's up megan here this is my
photo of my full body workout routine
this is the neck and traps portion that
which we do at the beginning
obviously you want to train your most
lagging bodybuilders first so we start
off with this um
uh neck and traps
uh giant set pretty much
since to target the slow twitch fibers
of the neck and trapezius complex stuff
like that i start off with um
neck curls right this is flexion not
extension
uh three sets of 25 reps like i said
it's a super sets a giant set so after
this i'll move immediately to the next
exercise which you guys are about to see
so anyway i started with that i'm using
marco sweater here usually i use a towel
on my knee pads whatever it is my knee
wraps
to um alleviate the pain on my forehead
from the weight so we start off with
like a lightweight 25 pounds we do about
20 reps 20 to 25 reps targeting the slow
twitch fibers
and
right after that i immediately move on
to
this
uh barbell upright rows
um
inside shoulder
grip once again targeting the neck and
trap region
no rest in between you know the only
rest you should have is just walking
from one station to the next
um not too heavy like i said again you
know we're hitting the slow twist fiber
so you don't want to go too heavy you
just want to make sure that
the muscle is doing the work if you go
too heavy then you're activating more
fat storage and you're using a lot of
momentum and things like that and going
really heavy is the the worst way to
improve a lagging slow twist
body part anyway
right after that i move on to seated
shrugs so that's the third part of the
tri set
seated strokes on the hammer machine
right here
uh
seated because at this point my traps
are fried
um tired and i'm you know you
when you at this stage your body is
gonna try his best to use momentum and
whatever he can to get the weight up so
that's why if you're doing triceps or
giant sets as you get closer to the
finishing exercises you want to be as
strict as possible so i sit down to take
my knees and legs out and i just focus
on you know striking the weight up
i actually actually like to see this
short variation is
it's a lot stricter yeah so i do this
whole cycle about you know three to four
times and it's before we begin our full
body split all right that's it i hope
this helps
you

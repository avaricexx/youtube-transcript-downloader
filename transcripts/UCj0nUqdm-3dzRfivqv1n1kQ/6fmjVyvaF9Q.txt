hey guys going on Megan here all right
so let's take a look at this poll which
of these four Foods has the most
carnitine for maximum Androgen receptors
testosterone receptors uh muscle group
in Fat Loss uh watch my video on
carnitine if you haven't this way I
don't have to repeat myself but uh
quick summary carnitine is an amino acid
that your body makes and then you could
also get from Foods so again I'm not
referring to the supplement I'm talking
about carnitine the natural natural
recurring substance
and has potent effects on again
antioxidant function lowering
inflammation increasing strength muscle
mass mainly fat loss because your body
needs carnitine to oxidize fatty acids
to actually shorten them into the
mitochondria
um it protects your cells from damage
from training helps speed up recovery
and obviously through that same pathway
um do that same mechanism it also
increases indirectly your energy
receptors because it stops them from
being
degraded and broken down so long story
short
is amazing and as always
you can get most of your carnitine from
food it's actually more bioavailable in
food than it is in shady ass supplements
but
which of these four Foods has the most
carnitine
is it chicken is it red meat is it is it
tofu slash soy or is it eggs the answer
is red meat so 77 of you [ __ ]
have this answer correct which is rare
because a lot of people are just wrong
on almost every pole that I put up
um but uh
I hope you guys didn't [ __ ] Google
this [ __ ] you know cheating bastards or
use chapter some [ __ ]
but I should expect a lot more from you
guys you know this this is something
that should be well known that's one of
the many many reasons why I highly
recommend eating red meat almost every
day
um within limits of course not only are
you getting the zinc and the selenium
and the B vitamins and and a little bit
of creatine and some carnosine but
you're getting a a good portion of
bioavailable carnitine so the correct
answer is red meat less quickly read the
answers and um
in fact let me see if I have a yeah it's
over 20 of people got this wrong wow
that's crazy but let's read the answers
and um the comments
and hopefully there's no uh smeagle
comments in here all right let's go I
swear Megan put tofu sorry just to be
able to laugh his ass off at each
individual what he gets yeah yeah cause
uh I was like man like
when I was thinking of the choices I was
like man like let's see chicken I'm
definitely gonna put chicken you guys
know I have like a [ __ ] holy Crusade
against chicken
um and I was like ah let me put a little
trick answer people know how much I
recommend eggs so this was the trick uh
choice and I was like all right let me
just put a full fight I'm just a troll
um but anyway let's go
I purposely put wrong answers to listen
to his funny ass friends guys it's funny
how you guys laugh at the rest but I'm
Legit getting pissed like the the the
the rants are not meant to be funny I I
legitimately get pitch guys because you
know I don't script videos just [ __ ]
record and talk that's what my videos go
on forever
um I just hate seeing those stupid ass
comments man those smeagle comments but
anyway um so yeah do not put wrong
answers just to see to see here rents in
fact now that I know that I'm gonna try
my best to not rent and to not get
pissed because now
um it'll be impossible to know if guys
are really idiots and when full [ __ ]
or if the car man is just somebody just
trying to get a reaction out of me but
you guys are [ __ ] up for this by the
way
um
just too Golden man
oh [ __ ] Megan I noticed something on my
mindset in testosterone usually around
mid terms finals I get super stressed
and get big
and get better as hell do I love I love
honest people man like uh the fact that
you could admit that uh this midterm
work this midterms worst issues bottom
top and my mindset changed I noticed I
feel awful as [ __ ] I just don't give a
[ __ ] I'm focused on getting things done
so to swap
um
oh yeah but yeah yeah I mean if stress
goes up your energy and status is going
to go down and your mindset is going to
change you know um so I always tell you
guys it's not all about testosterone you
have high testosterone but if your
cortisol goes to the roof not only
that's gonna eventually lower your
distance run but even if it doesn't
lower your testosterone because it takes
a while
um it's gonna block a lot of the effects
of testosterone you know tons of studies
on this where you you could increase
testosterone but if you inject the
person with cortisol or you create a
scenario that
um quickly increase the testosterone I
mean the cortisol you actually block a
lot of the effects of testosterone while
testosterone is still elevated it's
crazy that's why I always say lower
stress lower stress lower stress now you
don't want stress to be too low right
because once again you know what I'm
about to say even for the euchar right
you don't want anything to be too low or
too high if stress is too low then
you're not going to do [ __ ] you're gonna
have zero motivation
um because we need stress too too late
we need stress to conquer life when you
stretch to get out of bed when you
stress to have some forms of energy
should it be [ __ ] up
uh but yeah yeah so always look for ways
to lower stress you know the only kind
of stress you want is good stress right
acute stress like the gym sprinting
lifting weights uh that's the gym
um you know competing you know um taking
a risk that's going to have a good
payoff but it's actually safe
you know uh those kinds of stresses are
actually good cold showers anyway one
block
one block of tofu is greater than a
thousand milligrams of tests you guys
are [ __ ] trolls making I eat 30
ounces of tofu a day
me gonna eat 30 ounces of tofu a day and
play fortnite all night and I can still
always be a dump truck doesn't add a
genetics though
um
Megan you gotta make a video about CMOS
this is the high real fine I'm gonna
give you about it uh we're making those
tofu games tonight lads
um how does ground turkey fit into this
ground turkey if you if you notice I
never put it in my top five you know
it's because again obviously it has some
nutrients but I'm all about
how many birds can you hit with one
stone right I always recommend foods
that have
the biggest bang for your buck the
biggest return on investment you know
um because I you know you guys know I
love the Pareto Principle right
um 80 of your results usually come from
20 of your efforts that lasts almost
everything so you want the foods that
give you 80. you want the 20 of foods
that give you 80 of the nutrients and
turkey does not make it into the top
five right so it's not on the starting
lineup it's on the bench
um
red meat or Spanish colony so I took my
best smart guy smart guy
um
does uh soy electrician okay the
research behind that is actually
conflicting but because it's conflicting
that's why I avoid so I like the [ __ ]
plague I could show you some studies
that show that soy does not affect
testosterone negatively but I could also
show you some studies that show the
opposite so it depends on the
methodology uh depends on how you see
the population study the sample size
um but what's very consistent is that
soy products which do not they're not
confuse soy we just saw lecithin right
like again I explain a different video
but one thing that's
um that has a lot of evidence is that
eating soy does negatively affect your
testosterone to estrogen ratio to be
specific your testosterone to E2
astrodol that's very very consistent so
even the studies that show that soy does
not decrease testosterone some of these
studies show that it does [ __ ] up your T
to E2 ratio which why would you know you
don't want to [ __ ] with that not to
mention there's some studies that show
that
um whey protein is way better than soy
at boosting testosterone from training
or from different activities but anyway
again I I don't want to go up topic if
you want to make videos on soy but to me
it's best to avoid it right I don't want
anything that has conflicting evidence
as far as
affecting my T levels right it's bad
enough we surrounded by Plastics and
nutrient deficiencies and shitty soil
that's void of minerals and yeah the
last thing you want is to add another
substance that might or might not [ __ ]
up your T levels tofu is almost
antibiotic food ever
um I voted eggs but I think it's meat
beef carnitine dog Spanish there you go
smart [ __ ] right just like calling
the scene right
um
uh stay cooked around says yep yep there
you go yep the numbers vary you guys
could clearly see you know steak is at
the top
uh my mom had told me my mom told me I
have to get up and throw the lunch in
the fridge I could cook it later mom is
awesome she lets me cut me pause
um but yeah that's that's good that your
mom is letting you eat red meat
um red meat is always superior that's
right lots of protein saturated fat fat
subtle vitamins let's go you know
somebody did his research
um tofu because plant protein is the
highest quality protein it's easy to
digest but it produces a high
antioxidants that'll make you bloated oh
man uh hold on let's see if you saw me
in person you go wild I got he's a soy
boy oh man
if you're not eating stuff on the daily
what the [ __ ] are you doing you guys are
gonna like confuse a lot of teenagers
are going to read this and think that oh
God you know they're they're serious
beef because it is red like the blood of
our enemies
um
Savage who needs beef when you could
inject and smoke
I think lettuce is the answer
um
I would like a Civic discussion about so
sure sure yep there's a lot of conflict
dances but like I said just avoid it
avoid it um because anyway I would
explain that area one guy somewhere is
saying something yep I guarantee you
there's gonna be a guy in the comments
somewhere saying supplement supplements
uh It's gotta be eggs
why not supplement there you go there
you go
well actually he wrote that after this
so he probably wrote this because he saw
that
um
I inject 500 milligrams of Carnage in a
day but I don't take steroids in my 90
dude why
uh I'm gonna make a video about this
injecting quality and [ __ ]
um anyway tofu is more endogenic than
crab
peaches rub my a tofu and with rainbows
I don't know it doesn't matter you don't
matter [ __ ] off uh AG natural tea
booster which one of you both
definitely sorry bro so the way
people
are going to be surprised they will
answer this tofu
um I know red meat is the answer but I'm
choosing so because I'm a storyboard for
life asked by far the best if you think
all right so well yeah this one was an
unevent football most people know the
answer was red meat uh so that gives me
hope but anyway

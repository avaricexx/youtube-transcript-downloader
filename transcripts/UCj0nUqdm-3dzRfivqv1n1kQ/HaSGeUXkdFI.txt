hi guys in this video I'm going to show
you how to get laid first step is going
on how to do this slows one set I call
it the the Nephilim workout the Nephilim
shoulder workout Nephilim for giant you
guys know um it's one set one long set
of every variation of L you can think
about start off with a
like 10 10 or 12 lb dumbbell no higher
than 12 so 12 lbs Max 10 lbs maybe five
lbs if you if you're a little dude and
um pretty much you start with b over you
do as many as many uh variations as
possible so B over laterals um face
pulls whatever with the dumbbells and
you move on to side laterals you do
every variation of side lateral possible
then you move on to front raises and
upright rows and you end with shoulder
presses so you're doing one giant giant
giant set the goal of this is to put as
much blood as possible into your
shoulders into your shoulders it's by
the way got do holding the
camera and um get the crazy lactic acid
buildups you want this big big burn
right and um in fact in my full body
workout I don't train shoulders anymore
I just don't have time so I do
everything I can do at home at the gym
and when I come home I do this so if you
notice that my should has been getting
bigger or wider it's because of this
thing right here so focus on hypoxia the
burn start off with perfect form decent
form but as it gets hard start cheating
so about keeping the tension on the
muscle right get the blood in here so
for you form p these [ __ ] out

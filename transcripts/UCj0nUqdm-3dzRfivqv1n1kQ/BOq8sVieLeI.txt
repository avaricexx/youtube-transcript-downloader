hey guys what's going on megan here
muscle grows
extremely extremely fast and even though
i've mentioned that in several videos
people still underestimate how fast this
process actually takes place
now obviously it's going to take you a
long time to notice the results
but the actual growth process is
extremely rapid and then most people
it's actually done in less than a day or
two
but anyway this is another episode of
sunday study so we're going to take a
look at some quick studies
and what they have to do with all these
pictures here but anyway
first quick review on how muscles
actually build if you're a lifter you're
trying to put on games you have to
understand this process guys it's only
two steps
if you understand these two steps you're
good for the rest of your life right
first you have a trigger right which is
obviously lifting weights or steroids
which i'll be starting to recommend on
this channel
but anyway so step one is dna
transcription right guys for you to
build muscle
your body has to go to your dna find out
the genes related to whatever proteins
your body is trying to build
your body has to copy those instructions
it's that simple right so dna
transcription in a nutshell
it's simply your body going to your dna
finding the specific genes it needs
in this case you're just trying to build
a bigger bicep so you need contractile
proteins and stuff
it makes a copy of it and it translates
it that's it
that's how muscle is built it's
literally two steps right side we see
way more complex than that but to keep
this video short just memorize those two
steps guys you have dna transcription
dna translation right when you
transcribe dna you make a copy of the
gene right mrna
and eventually your body takes the amino
acids that you eat right the protein
from your diet whatever
puts it together along with water energy
blah blah blah boom
you build muscle now this entire process
takes place
in less than a day or two so every
single thing you do to build muscle
whether it's lifting waste increasing
volume
eating it falls down to these two steps
here right you're either increasing the
end of transcription
that's where testosterone comes in
that's where lifting heavier loads comes
in right
or you're increasing translation right
that's where volume comes in right
that's why i recommend high weekly
volume and all these things right the
more volume that you do
the more you increase the dna
translation rna translation and
obviously people who are on steroids
they're increasing both step one and
step two right
step one is where the androgen receptor
comes in but anyway this whole process
takes place in less than a day or two
and study after study after study
after study after study after study
after study have confirmed this
right whether you looked at myofibril
protein synthesis makes protein
sentences it doesn't matter right it
takes less than a day to now keep in
mind this is after you recover from
muscle damage right
so obviously if you're beginning are you
a noob first time in the gym it's
obviously going to take a little longer
than day or two simply because your body
has to first
repair the damage and wait for the
repeated body fat to kick in but for the
average person watching this video if
you've been lifting for a long time
this whole process peaks in less than a
day or two right
in fact in less than 24 hours you get a
peak and eventually it starts to decline
back to baseline
extremely fast now if you're on steroids
obviously you're going to keep protein
services elevated right so
it's still going to decline but not as
fast as somebody was 90 right so if
you're on the juice
it's going to peak obviously right and
stay elevated that's why
again that's why bro splits became very
popular
once steroids came into the picture you
know in the 1960s right because then you
could train your chest on [ __ ] monday
and wait until the next [ __ ] monday
to get it again and you still grow why
because you're keeping protein sentences
elevated
if you're a natty you don't have that
[ __ ] advantage your body is going to
synthesize as much protein as possible
and it's going to drop back to baseline
extremely fast now guys you gotta
understand
the reason why this process is so fast
is because even if you're putting on a
pound of muscle a month which is a ton
of muscle by the way you know if you
if you're putting a pound of muscle a
month after your um after you've been
training for a long time you are [ __ ]
blessed but
even a pound of muscle that's only 15
grams of muscle a day if you think about
it right if your body is building in
you know at a constant rate which
obviously is not but you know to make
the math easier it's about 15 grams a
day
right it doesn't take that long to make
15 grams of muscle
and if you look at it from a protein
standpoint only about 20 percent of that
protein which is about 3 grams of
protein a day that's it
3 grams of protein a day comes out to a
pound of muscle a month
so that's why this process is extremely
fast now of course the reason why we
don't notice the gains
is because i mean again if you put on 50
grams of muscle you can't see that [ __ ]
right
so what eventually gets you big is the
constant
spikes of protein sentences from workout
after workout after work
that's why it takes years to achieve a
great physique is because you have to
keep protein sentences elevated
day after day after day week after week
month after month right
so even though the process is extremely
extremely fast
it takes a long time to see results
because like i said 50 grams of months
of the day you can't [ __ ] see that
[ __ ] right but if you keep protein
sentences elevated and you synthesize
those tissues
day after day after death the day you're
gonna see which is fast and that's why
once you address for time again back to
the video that i made last week
nucleus overload high frequency training
combined with blood flow restriction or
not
destroys every other method of training
when it comes to
building muscle fast keep in mind i say
time adjusted right so if time is an
issue
higher frequency is the key now keep in
mind if you don't train with a higher
frequency you're still going to put on
muscle
it's just going to take you longer right
so you're both going to reach the exact
same genetic limit
as uh whether you're doing the bro split
or full body whatever you're all going
to reach the same genetic limit
but one person is going to get the
faster the person again
who's training more frequently because
he's keeping protein sentences elevated
or the person who's obviously on
steroids why does it take only a day or
two for your body to build muscle why is
it so fast i told you guys
all the growth factors and all the
things that are linked to hypertrophy
peak after 24 hours some less than 24
hours from the spike in igf-1
from android and receptor binding the
decrease in myostatin the increase in
phylostat and
mto activation all of those things the
increase in blood flow
all of those things peak in less than 24
hours for the train lifter
the person who's been training for a
long time and are we surprised
we were hunters and gatherers for tens
of thousands of years guys the body had
to find
quick ways to adapt to the low the daily
low depending on what your daily
activities were if you were primarily a
hunter
the body had to adapt quickly guys your
body couldn't say hey you know what we
can only hunt on monday and then we have
to wait until next monday
to do all that exhaustive work hell no
the body had to find
quick ways to adapt depending on your
daily activities that's why if you look
at some hunter-gatherer tribes who are
still alive to the state
the best hunter is usually jacked as
[ __ ] for some of this is from the namal
tribe look at the best hunter in the
group
he is ripped like a [ __ ] keep in
mind these guys are not bodybuilders
they're not on steroids
they're in the [ __ ] forest somewhere
and the daily hunting the for example
guys you know how hard it is you use a
bow like an actual strong bow
pulling that [ __ ] requires so much
[ __ ] strength your biceps come into
play
your wrong boys your mid trapezius i
mean look at his traps guys
best hunter in the group not only
requires extreme strength to pull the
ball
but also you have to carry the prey
bring it back climb the trees
some of these guys especially guys who
have a high protein diet again the best
hunters
usually have the high protein diet right
so he's not going to go in
and [ __ ] hunt on monday and say oh
you know what my traps are sore my wrong
boys are so my biceps are so i'm going
to wait until next [ __ ] monday
before i go on the hunt again [ __ ] no
right this tribe is going to [ __ ]
stop
especially to run out of berries and
plants and [ __ ] but anyway i'm going to
make a separate video by showing you
guys the life of
hunter gatherers again same thing with
neanderthals right the reason why there
was so much more drag
i explained before not you know uh
northern latitude and all that stuff
bargains rule but also
these guys were 90 plus carnivores right
hunting was
their main way of getting food because
obviously in ice age europe you're not
going to find berries every day you're
not going to find plants and fruits
every day
so they were getting the majority of the
calories from hunting which was an
extreme full body workout especially
the animals these guys were hunting you
know mammoths and wooly rhinos and [ __ ]
that's a full body workout right
their forearms their biceps their back
their legs everything
was activated right and the body just
can't afford to take [ __ ] seven days
to recover from a hunt because these
guys had to carry the food back home
if they were successful they could take
a break if they were not successful
which again most hunts were not
successful they had to go all the way
back the next day
over and over again that's why the body
has evolved to recover faster than most
people think that's why if you notice
whenever you start doing nucleus
overload or high frequency training at
first you're sore as [ __ ] right
but the repeated body effect kicks in so
fast that after a while you recovered
like the very next days as if you didn't
even [ __ ] lift
the body is made to adapt guys same
thing with these buff-ass
chimps right you guys are very familiar
with these pictures i might do a fun
fact friday on that but pretty much
when chips have alopecia and they lose
their hair you get to really see how
jack chimps are and why didn't have so
much muscle
yeah of course they also have more
phosphorus muscles than humans but
remember these guys are constantly
swinging from trees and [ __ ] so they're
doing lap pull downs and [ __ ]
you know one arm rolls and one on
pulldowns every [ __ ] day man
and we know it's because of the activity
that they look so jacked because
when the when the chimp is uh
immobilized whether they're you know
they're sick or they're injured or
um they're not allowed to put into an
environment where they can't swing all
day
they lose a ton of muscle mass a ton so
that's how you know it's not just a
genetic thing it's not just
all chimps are just buff just naturally
no they buff because of their daily
activity
because once you remove that and it's
the same for chimps the same for rats
the same for for every animal out there
they lose a ton of muscle mass
the moment you take them out of their
normal environment out of their normal
daily activities when it comes to chimps
it's obviously
swinging on trees and vines and [ __ ]
look at this [ __ ] man look at his desk
look at his biceps
carrying the entire body weights from
three to three and if you look at humans
the reverse is also true right when
people when astronomers go in space
one of the first things that happen is
they lose a ton of muscle mass why do
you think that is
there's no gravity in space see people
think that our legs are naturally big
just
just because they're supposed to be big
no your legs are baby because you're
walking in [ __ ] all day
they've done experiments where if you
just go into space where there's no
gravity in less than two weeks you lose
a ton
of muscle your legs come back looking
like smeagol so our legs are not big
because they're just
naturally big they're big because we're
walking in [ __ ] all day
tension and the reason why they don't
just keep growing for average because
obviously you're not progressively
overloading right you're not
you know adding weight to your to your
[ __ ] back every day but
if you did your legs would get bigger
and bigger why do you think fat people
have big ass calves the calves grow in
proportion to the increase in weight
right
same thing if you try to lie down on the
bed all day try to lie down for a week
or two weeks without walking at all you
will lose a ton of muscle take a chimp
and stop him from swinging for several
weeks at a time
he loses all these [ __ ] gains so
these [ __ ] are doing nucleus overload
every [ __ ] day and you guys remember
the video i made about burton last year
right
very very inspiring guy lost the use of
his legs so pretty much he was using his
legs like a straight balance using his
arms
to replace his legs so he would
literally just walk on his arms
carrying the weight of his entire body
every single day and the result
he developed massive triceps because
obviously he's pretty much doing so low
every day if you think about it
and huge ass forearms because that's
literally his new legs
watch the v watch that video that i made
it's insane he's so inspiring he was
like [ __ ] a wheelchair
i'm gonna walk on my [ __ ] arms and
his arms blew the [ __ ] up and he barely
goes to the gym
guys anything that keeps protein
sentences elevated day after day which
is mechanical tension
day after day is going to rapidly
increase muscle growth right
and speaking of chimps guys why do you
think gymnasts who
specialize in ring work right because
not all gymnasts specialize in ring work
but the ones who do
most of the ones we do have huge ass
[ __ ] biceps not what you're going to
say oh they don't stir those
guys every athlete is on [ __ ]
steroids right at the top level they're
all on steroids right but yeah they
don't have [ __ ] biceps like this
right these guys are doing and i
mentioned them in my nicosia videos
years ago right these guys are literally
doing
bicep work every [ __ ] day it's just
pull-ups right and they have better
biceps than some bodybuilders out there
again keeping protein sentences elevated
right they don't do ring work on
monday and say oh oh uh my biceps are so
let me come back next monday no
they're switching back and forth between
different exercises that still activate
their arms
one way or another same thing with
strong man i always talk about strong
men and their big ass
traps right ninety percent of strongman
exercise is a trap exercise
they're always lifting heavy as [ __ ] off
the ground
right and the result they have bigger
traps than most bodybuilders
yes of course i know you're going to
mention or try out some high energy
restrictors we know that but again not
everyone will abuse the steroids as big
traps
in fact there are a ton of bodybuilders
who again take huge doses of steroids
they have [ __ ] traps you know what i'm
talking about have you seen kai green
straps
van pakowski you think these guys don't
take steroids so it's a combination
obviously the drugs but also the
activity
constantly lifting heavy [ __ ] off the
ground keeping protein sinuses in their
traps
super elevated from the steroids and the
constant lifting
the farmer walks the dead lifts the
stones
and the other example i always mention
right ballerinas and they [ __ ] ass cats
i mean ballerinas have calves
of peace especially the ones who've been
doing it for a long time what are you
gonna tell me they're all on steroids
too
it's just calf work man every single day
keeping protein sentences elevated track
cyclists especially the ones who
specialize in the spraying events right
the majority of them have huge squads
obviously not all of them look like this
[ __ ] monster here right
but the majority of them have mega
developed cars why
because every [ __ ] day is leg day
they're either on the bike
or they're doing leg work in a gym and
then back on the bike again
keeping protein sentences elevated and
if these guys decided to just stop
writing and focus on bodybuilding you
guys know what happened they would build
monster [ __ ] quads so conclusion guys
muscle is built extremely fast you just
have to keep
elevating protein sentences right most
of you [ __ ] still train the muscle
once a day and you wonder why it's
taking you so long to grow again if
you're on the juice
grt or you have insane genetics fine by
all means
but for the rest of the population the
rest of us you have to keep
elevating protein sentences again as
long as you recover from muscle damage
right usually after three weeks of
lifting
um the repeated body fat kicks in fully
and and muscle damage is no longer an
issue right as long as you don't overdo
it in a gym that's why i would say try
not to do too much in the gym right just
do enough to stimulate protein sentences
and get the [ __ ] out right because
you're going to be back there very soon
but if you go to the gym and you do
[ __ ] 50 cents per body party in one
day
you're going to create way more muscle
damage and actually slow down your
products because remember guys
muscle protein synthesis only increases
muscle size
once damage is recovered right so if you
create too much damage
you're actually shooting yourself in the
foot by anyway that's it guys remember
guys if you're doing high frequency
training or full body training or
nicosia load or whatever the [ __ ] you
want to do right anything that involves
high weekly volume
high frequency there's a big drawback
your recovery management has to be on
point i repeat that over and over again
right
so don't forget the top 10 rules of
nucleus overload or
any higher frequency program you want to
undertake you
have to manage recovery well else you're
actually going to lose gains all right

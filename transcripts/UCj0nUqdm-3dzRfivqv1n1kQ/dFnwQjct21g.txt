hey guys what's going on megan here
sorry it's been a while been really busy
with the stock market i haven't really
had time to make videos
but i had to make a video on this topic
you guys know i was a huge
huge fan of ronnie coleman growing up um
as a kid
and i watched the entire interview with
joe rogan
and me and my friends were arguing about
this topic here so i was like you know
let me make a video about this you know
see what my subscribers think
and i'm gonna give my opinion uh we're
arguing about the interview because
right he said he was natural um and he
didn't start using steroids until he
turned 30
and um that's pretty much when he took
off right and of course everyone is
divided on error so i'm like oh no he's
full of [ __ ] there's no way in hell
uh he was naughty um and
some are saying that you know you know
maybe there is some truth to that maybe
he wasn't eddie so i'll give you guys my
opinion
all right so again quick background he's
on a journaling show
and um that's you know there was a part
where you know joe asked them about
steroids and they were talking about
you know the complications that come
with that blah blah blah blah long story
short
um and you know joe was mentioning how
uh he knew people who used to abuse
steroids and they didn't make it to the
age of 30.
and that's when ronnie mentioned that he
was actually clean um and didn't start
taking steroids to
you know to the age of 30. so
let me tell you guys what i think i
think it's not lying
i think it's not lying right and i'm
gonna show you exactly why check this
here right
this is ronnie when you gotta say no
reason number one right reason number
one
mine is a genetic freak right everyone
knows this ronnie probably has the best
genetics on the planet
on the planet right um and that's saying
a lot right because i because obviously
we've seen a lot of genetic
freaks come and go but no one no one
comes close around here i'm even phil
heath is a genetic freak
but he's nowhere near ronnie coleman's
level right and that's saying a lot
right
but check this out so this is ronnie
when he was a teenager right
i don't know the exact age but that's
when he was a teenager right and you can
actually tell
keep in mind he played football you know
he played football in high school
and in college so this is him as a
teenager so you can actually see that
obviously he had uh above average
genetics
this is him um i don't know he's
actually aged but he's definitely
less than 20 right 20 or less because he
graduated from college
at the age of 20. so this was him
playing football
in uh in college he was the linebacker i
believe
and again you can see you know 511 good
build
you know bbc genetics all of that right
and obviously he was living at the time
right and this is him when he won his
first show not not
professional show but i think it was
like the you know some show in texas
and he was about 26 right um again
looks you know looks pretty good uh and
most of you guys would say well he had
to be on steroids
i don't think so guys because think
about it here he was about 26 years old
right
and this is him at 29 right before he
turns 30 right because he said that he
started taking him out
sorry i had to mute my phone but this is
him at 29 right age 29
right and keep in mind around this time
he's been lifting for a long [ __ ]
time right so you got good genetics
and someone who delivered the following
time how do i know that well think about
it if he was playing football since he
was in high school right
so uh let's say he started playing
football at age 16. obviously he started
before that but
just to be safe let's say he started
around 15 16 right
um and obviously if you if you're
playing football you're working out
right facts
especially if you're a linebacker so
from age
16 to age 29
right that's 13 years of lifting right
probably not
uh not consistently but it's still
lifting especially
still 13 years of lifting and he was
also doing powerlifting and things like
that
so if after 13 years of lifting with
some of the best genetics in the world
you can't have this physique then we all
[ __ ] guys like like
what's the point of even working out
right this is the guy with the best
genetics in the [ __ ] world
right if after 13 years of lifting he
can't achieve this physique naturally
then why are we even lifting so let's be
real right so that's why i believe that
he's actually not bullshitting right um
if he wasn't
on the juice it was probably very very
low uh
doses so that's the first two reasons
right in fact he's a genetic freak and
the fact that he's been lifting for well
over a decade
uh at this point here the third and
final reason why i believe he was
natural
uh on very very very low doses until
the age of 30 as he claims is because
guys
let's not forget that this is what
ronnie eventually morphed into
right so this is him at age 29 this is
him later in his career you know up
until you know his mid to late 30s
right it doesn't look like the same
person
it's like a completely different person
so let's say he was around what uh
we'll say around 210 200 pounds maybe
right
definitely not more than 220 here right
he definitely was not more than 220
pounds so let's just pick 210 pounds
there
right just to be conservative and
eventually he went to you know
290 300 pounds on stage right so how do
you go from
uh let's say 210 pounds to
close to 300 pounds so about so 90
pounds of muscle and this is obviously
lean muscle right because
you know again it's the stage weight so
how do you put on 90 pounds
of muscle if he was already taking
steroids around this time right so
that's why it doesn't make sense guys
there's no way in hell he was taking
steroids when he was
under 30 because where did this growth
come from
right that's not just from eating right
he had to hop on the juice after the
stage i mean it
it's obvious guys it's obvious you do
not put on 90 [ __ ] pounds up to 90
pounds of muscle
right um if you were already on steroids
for years prior to that
right and that's why i believe him just
from just from looking at the
transformation that he made
uh because he said he started taking
stars at 30 and that was around 1994 i
believe
right and the transformation that he
made after 1994
right so 95 he won his first pro show i
believe in
1995. so from 95 all the way to 2003
2004
um the amount of mass that he put on
that
had to come or finally happen on the
gear
i mean look at his legs right even his
calves
look at his chest look at his lats
right so yeah so that's why i believe
that ronnie cohen was actually telling
the truth you know
um i mean you know going from here right
somebody with amazing genetics
and on this picture here over 13 years
of
experience life thing right transforming
into this base here
right what change obviously there's
obviously food you know you obviously
have to eat a lot more food
but you don't just eat and go from here
to here right it had to be
uh because you finally got on the juice
right
that's how to explain that from age 26
to 29 right so for
for three years there's barely any
change and then
boom you turn into that
all right so yeah so i absolutely
believe him and um
believe that before the age of 30 it was
natural
um or on some very very shitty steroids
because you know
like i said that that transformation
after the age of 30 was just insane
but still let me know what you guys
think and um
and stop underestimating what the human
body can do naturally you know you'd be
amazed if you have really really good
genetics
top class elite genetics you'd be amazed
at how much muscle uh people can put on
you know watch my video watch my last
video
on um uh west african genetics and stuff
in fact i really believe that ronnie
coleman takes a genetic test uh takes an
ancestry test
i guarantee you he's probably from ghana
nigeria
you know somewhere in our region
somewhere in our region uh i'm
eighty percent sure it's probably in
algeria you know just by looking at its
facial features
um but we'll find out anyway uh watch my
last video on genetics and
uh bbc genetics and all that stuff all
of this is gonna make a lot more sense

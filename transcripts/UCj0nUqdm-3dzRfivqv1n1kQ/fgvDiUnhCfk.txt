hey guys what's going on megan here so
check out the drop in myostatin
from the four different groups right you
have the resistance training group
so that they were just lifting weights
and here's the reduction in the
myostatin levels
you have the resistance training plus
epicathogen group and as you can see
they have the biggest drop in my
statin keep in mind this is chocolate
i'm using chocolate to represent
epicathogen right so this is not dudu
this is chocolate
you have the group that only took
epicathogen and as you can see they have
a
very very very small drop in myostatin
and obviously you have the placebo group
right the group that didn't do anything
and as you can clearly see the myostatin
levels stayed high
as expected and it gets even better when
you look at the phylostatin levels once
again here's a resistance training group
huge spike in phyllostatin which is
obviously the number one myostatin
blocker
you have the resistance training plus
epicathogen group
which gave the biggest spike in
phytostatin and you have this is the
impressive part the group that only took
epic action and didn't do a single thing
still got a significant increase in
palestine and obviously the placebo
group
didn't really change much another study
was also done this time on rats
and they got the exact same result as
you can tell here the young rats and the
old rats
there goes the myostatin levels as you
can see the control group had high
levels of myostatin
but the group that took epicathogen had
significantly lowered my statin levels
same thing with the old group right high
my style levels at baseline
reduced significantly once they took
epicathogen
and just like in the human study we also
have the same effect
on phylostatin the control group is on
the left side and on the right side as
you can see
a bigger spike in phallostatin from
taking epicathogen same thing with the
old group
huge spike in phylostatin in the third
experiment they looked at the effects of
epicathogen for just seven days so
pretty much seven days of supplementing
with epicathogen
and as you can see at baseline the young
group had significantly lower myostatin
levels than the old group
and that's expected right that's the
reason why old people have a hard time
putting on muscle compared to young
people
young people simply have less myostatin
and more phylostatin
so even at baseline you can clearly see
the reason why we tend to lose muscle as
we age
our myostatin levels go through the roof
the same is also true for our phallic
statin levels as you can see the young
group had higher levels of phylostatin
while the old group had lower levels and
after they supplemented with epicathogen
for seven days
they had a seven percent increase in
hand grip strength
and they also had a huge increase in
their phallus stands for myostatin
levels
so as you can clearly see guys epicathon
has
anabolic effects anyway this is another
episode of myostatin monday where we
talk about
everything related to myostatin for
those who are new myostatin is the
protein your body makes that limits how
much muscle you can put on
which is why animals or humans who are
missing the myostatin g and or have a
mutation in the myostatin gene
look like absolute monsters so for
anyone who's interested in building
muscle
myositis should be number one on your
list on things to optimize
and if you watch my other videos on my
stand you're already familiar with the
different examples
on what scientists have done in the lab
for example this mouse here
is lacking the myostatin gene and is
genetically engineered to overproduce
phylostatin so
you can clearly see the difference in
size four times the amount of muscle
mass
there's another example here look at the
lag difference normal mouse
brolic mouse another difference here
side by side
not only they have a lot more muscle but
they also have significantly less body
fat
than the regular mice here's an example
of a monkey that was injected with
phylostatin
in just a few weeks look at the
difference in his quad and of course
he's a 10 year old kid
that was lucky enough to be missing both
his myostatin jeans
as you can clearly see at 10 years old
he has six-pack abs
traps of peace wrong boys calves
you name it and as i mentioned several
times myostatin is also the reason why
irb bodybuilders have this cartoonish
physique right
one of the effects of anabolic steroids
is to upregulate the phytostatin pathway
and down regulate the milestone pathway
that's also why every
unnatural myostatin inhibitor is
currently banned
by the world anti-doping agency
especially since athletes have recently
been looking into gene doping
now as a natural should you worry about
your myostatin levels absolutely
the most important gene for hypertrophy
is obviously acura in one which has the
highest correlation we've ever seen on
record
pretty much you cannot build significant
muscle without this gene and sure enough
it is cock-blocked by myostatin
other studies and other men have shown
that after training
those who reduce myostatin the most are
the ones who put on the most size
my status was the reason why old women
have a very hard time putting on muscle
for those of you guys who don't know
old women are the most anabolic
resistant people on the planet
as you can see here after training old
men have a decent reduction in myostatin
which allows them to put on muscle
young men have the biggest drop in
myostatin which once again explains why
it is so easy for young men to put on
muscle
young women have a decent drop in
myostatin and obviously as you can see
here old women
have a very hard time dropping my style
even after they lift weights which is
why they have anabolic resistance
now number one way to drop myostatin is
obviously through training
literally just getting your ass in the
gym and lifting weights it's going to
give you the biggest drop in my statin
the only drawback is that the biggest
drop you get in my style from training
is at the eight hour mark after that
my stance starts to slowly go back
towards baseline which is once again why
it is so important
to train with high frequency if you're
natural the second way to significantly
drop myostatin is through creatine i
already made a video about that make
sure you check it out
here you can see the group on the left
that just trained without creatine
dropped my style by a small amount
whereas the group that trained with
creatine
had a huge drop in milestone which
obviously leads to more gains
now back to epicathogen does it work
absolutely based on the few studies we
have
we clearly see a huge effect of
epicathogen on phallostatin and
myostatin levels
now keep in mind that's not the only
benefits of epicathogen
it's been shown to increase nitric oxide
production so that's obviously going to
help you get a big pump in the gym
it's been shown to increase energy
levels mainly through
mitochondriogenesis
a household recovery mainly through its
antioxidant properties
and it's also been shown to regulate
blood sugar right so if you have high
blood sugar
type 2 diabetes or blood pressure issues
this is right in your alley and there
are over 600 studies on epicathogen
so it's not some new mystery molecule
it's been out for a very long time and i
mentioned on this channel several times
now whereas the founders found mainly
chocolate specifically dark chocolate
but obviously the amount of dark
chocolate you have to eat to get enough
epic action
is not practical right you're going to
get fat as [ __ ] and come back and say
hey megan told me to eat chocolate and
i'm a fat piece of [ __ ] no
don't get it from chocolate get it from
pure cocoa powder right
unsweetened minimally processed cocoa
powder right that's where you're going
to get the biggest bang for your buck
in fact it has the highest epic
gathering content
out of all the plants out there remember
guys this is a flavor noise so it's
found in many many many plants but once
again
cocoa powder has the highest amount by
far so as always i
don't recommend you buy this [ __ ] from
supplement companies you guys already
know how i feel about most of my
companies right
i'm not a big fan of recommending
supplements to you guys
especially if you get it from foods
right nature is your best friend if i
can't get a supplement from foods
i don't even waste my time with very few
exceptions
so once again do not buy epicathogen
supplements
either don't get it at all or get it
from foods right not to mention that
they're overpriced as [ __ ] right they're
not worth the price
trust me there's no point in dropping
that much money when the most you're
gonna get out of it
is a slight increase in strength a
slight increase in muscle mass
and all the other benefits i mentioned a
few minutes ago now as far as how much
do you need how much epicathogen do you
need
most studies use the standard one
milligram per kilogram of body weight so
if you weigh
80 kilogram you could start with 80
milligrams probably double that
now as far as getting it from chocolate
once again forget it right you're gonna
have to eat so much chocolate that it
defeats the purpose because you're just
gonna get fat as [ __ ] way too many
calories
now if you're attempting to get it from
cocoa powder there's about 160
milligrams for every 100 grams of cocoa
powder as long as it's not alkalized
right it has to be as unprocessed as
possible i'll repeat
make sure it's not sweetened make sure
it's not alkalized
make sure it's pure unsweetened
cocoa powder as close to its natural
state as possible
that's what's going to have the highest
amount of epicathogen if it's alkalized
it's going to have a lot less
so you're looking at 160 milligrams of
epicathogen
uh per 100 grams of pure
non-alkalized cocoa powder so if you
weigh 80 kilograms you only need 80
milligrams right so that means you only
need about half of that
which is about 50 grams of cocoa powder
but you're still a lot right so what i
used to do years ago when i was
bodybuilding you guys know i stopped
about a bit
years ago now i don't even give a [ __ ] i
just lift weights recreationally
but back when i was bodybuilding i was
using about one to two ounces a day
right so that comes out
to 28 to 56 grams of cocoa powder and i
was just putting that [ __ ] in my protein
shake
or in whatever else i could put it in
pancakes you name it
so that's how i was getting my
epicathogen back in the days
and obviously i was doing the usual
canola in spanish blah blah blah right
so
again as naturals anything that gives us
even five percent better performance in
the gym or five percent more strength on
our lips
is well worth the effort in my opinion
so conclusion epic
ethogen works um it's kind of a hassle
to get from food so you can only get it
from cocoa powder
it has a ton of benefits and i mainly
recommend it
if you're trying to break through a
plateau or if you're trying to get that
extra push or extra increase in
performance
it's cheap it's natural stay away from
supplements
and um if water decides to ban happy
catholicism you don't have to worry
because once again you'll be getting it
from chocolate anyway
and that's about it i'm definitely
looking forward to a lot more studies on
this we need at least
two to three more studies on trained men
so we can see
the full potential of this molecule
because it does a whole bunch of things
every year there's like a new uh
newfound use for epic attitude but

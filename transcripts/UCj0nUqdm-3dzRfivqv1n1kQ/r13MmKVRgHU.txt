okay guys here are the ingredients
you need some cabbage some cheap salt
some cheap black pepper some garlic
powder
and some cheap onion powder any
seasoning of your choice
it's a low budgetary muscle so you're
going to see a lot of the smoker by the
way you'll see a lot of
cheap brand seasoning all right first
thing you want to do is you want to
turn on the fire really high look at
your cabbage
after you chop that up in small pieces
you want to throw it in there
at this point the pot is empty
put it in there wait till it starts
sizzling the fires will be really high
in the first few seconds
the goal of this is to get the cabbage
to sweat and caramelize but i'll show
you how to get how to do this
all right now it's time to add your
seasoning about 15 seconds into the
thing put your salt mine wasn't coming
out so i had to do it a lot of times but
put the salt make sure it's everywhere
the seasoning is the best part of this
you got to make sure you pick your
favorite seasoning that's the seasoning
i use
garlic powder and then onion powder
black pepper
whatever you use whatever seasoning you
like if you like pepper you can throw
that in
and after you put the seasoning you want
to put your olive oil
right you put your olive oil about two
tablespoons you know you don't want to
put too much oil you just want to put
enough so it won't stick to the bottom
of the pan
all right mix it up mix it up real good
you want to mix this you want to coat
the the cabbage with the seasoning and
the oil all that combined together you
know
mix it up mix it up at this point the
flame is still high now right after this
you want to cut it down to really low
and i'm going to show you guys how low
the industry
should be really low because from this
point on you just wanted to
sweat 15 minutes later it's done man
caramelized cabbage delicious
man you could eat it with rice sweet
potato whatever you want
all right hope that fills your request

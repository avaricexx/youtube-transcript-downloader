hey guys going on megan here so i've
been getting a lot of questions about
the three african ufc champions
why are all three of them from pretty
much the same region in africa
is it a coincidence is it genetics is it
luck and keep in mind in my video last
year i told you guys that the best
genetics
in west africa come from this region
right and i told you guys specifically
ghana nigeria cameroon
and also congo by the way sure enough
this is also where mike tyson's
ancestors are from
and look this is exactly where the three
ufc
champions are from nigeria and cameron
see i told you guys this region keep in
mind guys i'm west african so i grew up
there this region
produces the craziest genetics you've
ever seen
and to put in perspective the odds of
having all those champions
come from those places guys look this is
a graph
of all the men in the world of fighting
age as you can see
the majority of them are in asia
followed by the rest of africa europe
south america usa and look how small
look where cameroon is and look where
nigeria is
so as you can clearly see this is not
about luck this is not about coincidence
the odds are extremely extremely low
that you will have three ufc champions
from those regions
but anyway guys this is another episode
of fun fact friday
it's probably going to be up tomorrow
because i'm not editing that [ __ ]
tonight
but long story short it's the series
where we go over all the genetics
of all the different races and
ethnicities in the world and the
different sports
or professions that dominate in so if
you haven't watched the previous
episodes make sure you catch up
we cover europeans east africans west
africans
asians central europeans latinos
almost everyone now remember to
disclaimer no racism is allowed on this
channel
we go over every ethnicity and every
race
regardless of the pros and cons everyone
has advantages and disadvantages right
no one race is superior in all things
that's not how natural selection works
all right so we're all different
and we're all good at different things
so i don't want to see no one in the
comments section
preaching supremacist [ __ ] i don't
care if your white supremacists or black
supremacists get the [ __ ] off my channel
we should be able to have these
conversations without turning the
comment section into
a race wall as i explained before the
reason why we have
genetic differences is because we
adapted the different biomes of the
world as we migrated out of africa
and we've also interbred with different
archaic species you know
denisovans neanderthals
and even other unknown species in africa
right so that's why we have so many
uh that's why even though we saw similar
we also have so many genetic
differences and what i like to call
superpowers
now of course there are differences in
outliers right for example there are
very fast white men
yaming is asian but he's taller than
shaq and obviously mark henry was a very
good strong man even though the sport is
dominated by europeans so
they are obviously outliers but we're
not talking about outliers here we're
talking about on average
and last thing stop mentioning culture
guys stop saying it's all about culture
it's all about culture
[ __ ] no right the average pygmy is less
than five feet tall
you mean to tell me that in the nba
because the culture because they don't
like the nba
no [ __ ] they're not tall enough
to play the nba so you have to factor in
genetic
limitations all right so let's quickly
go over west african dominance
all right so let's look at the stats
let's quickly look over the dominance of
west african descendants
in fast twitch dominant sports in this
case sprinting
again vast majority of west african
descents this is the top 10
fastest times at the olympics and as you
can see all of them are west african
descendants
even the record for five-year-olds west
african descendant
the record for women the fastest women
ever the majority including number one
west african descendant young girls
under the age of 18
the majority west african descendants
girls as young as five
the record holder west african descent
even in the nfl
the fastest position as you can see
cornerback
safety and wide receiver as you can see
dominated by west african descendants
the 40-yard dash record at the nfl
combine west african descendants
the vertical jump records west african
descendants
the broad jump record west african
descendants so as you can clearly see
something is going on here right
you have to be a complete [ __ ] to
think that genetics don't play a role
and sure enough if you look at the
genome of west africans
and their descendants there are a ton of
genetic adaptations and mutations
that have the highest frequency in west
africa
for example the most myostatin mutations
are in sub-saharan africa androgen
receptor sensitivity
as you guys know black people have the
highest
sensitivity to androgens that's why they
also have the highest
cases of prostate cancer right so it's a
double-edged sword
a social-wise they blow the [ __ ] up on
steroids
the average person can take steroids and
you barely notice a difference whereas
the average black person takes steroids
and
they look like the hulk in like six
months is because the androgen receptors
are very very sensitive
the actin in three gene which is again
the protein found mostly in fat storage
muscles
allows you to produce force allows you
to recover faster from muscle damage
in short it makes you explosive as [ __ ]
and as you can see
west africans are at the very top when
it comes to actin and three
favorable genotypes followed by
jamaicans which are again descendants of
west africans
african americans which are also the
centers of west africans and then you
can see the rest of the world and the
list continues igf-1 mutations
lowest amounts of vitamin d binding
protein which is obviously a good thing
longest arm-to-height ratio which is
obviously great for mma it keeps your
opponent at bay
due to the longer reach fast twist
muscle fibers
west africans have more than any other
race glycolytic and anaerobic enzymes
the ace gene especially the dd
polymorphism
they're second only to a wraps so that
gives them an advantage
anything that requires raising your
blood pressure as fast as possible
such as combat sports the ck gene for
creatine kinase
and obviously lowest hemoglobin
concentrations and highest rates
of sickle cell which as we all know
makes you fast towards dominant
and there are a bunch of other genes
that i can go over in future videos
that west africans have the highest
frequencies of
and if you notice the vast majority of
them are all related to fast twitch
muscle fibers power output
not strength power output remember
stratified power two completely
different things
power has the element of speed strength
doesn't now why why do i have so many
genes that make them fast towards
dominant
it's mainly because of malaria guys i
mentioned in a longer video
look at the death rate for malaria in
the whole world
look where they're concentrated 94
of malaria deaths every single year come
from this region
that is insane guys and what offers the
best protection against malaria
lower hemoglobin and sickle cell all of
which make you
fast watch dominant it's about pure
accident guys
if you fast switch dominant you are
extremely resistant
to malaria whereas if you slow towards
dominant you are [ __ ] because remember
the malaria parasite needs your
hemoglobin to multiply
that's why the regions in the world have
the most malaria deaths
also produce the most fast twitch
dominant people
it's all because of this fuck-ass
mosquito and sure enough look here
in 2019 six countries accounted for half
of all malaria deaths and look who's at
number one nigeria
coincidence see i told you guys it's all
about natural selection
and here's where it gets crazy notice
how all the malaria deaths are here and
how sick of cell and being
faster's dominant protection from
malaria check out the regions
in the entire world with the most
sickest cell trait
and sickle cell anemia see the map is
literally identical to this one and it's
not just correlation there's causation
when you have sickle cell or
low hemoglobin or phase dominant you
have from 50 to 70 percent
resistance to malaria an example is my
sister she's fast switch dominant she's
anemic
whereas i'm not and when we grew up i
had malaria almost
every other month meanwhile she was just
chilling and to this day she puts on
muscle in her legs
so [ __ ] fast even when she sprints
without any training
she's fast as [ __ ] and of course
african-americans are descendants of
west africa and so look secret saudis is
in the united states
look how much higher it is for blacks
compared to every other race
because again the descendants of west
africans that came over from the
atlantic slave trade right
so it has nothing to do with selective
breeding from slavery
people love that theory that's been
debunked so many times that oh you know
the slave owners brought the the
strongest slave blah blah blah [ __ ]
when the human genome project came out
we found out that theory was full of
[ __ ] guys because when we looked at the
genes
of west africans who didn't go through
the slave trade and didn't go through
selective breeding
and we compared them to african
americans we found out that west
africans still
have more fast towards dominant genes
than african americans
and white supremacists hated that
discovery because now they could no
longer take credit
for the athleticism of african americans
you know this whole time they thought oh
yeah it's because of us it's because we
brought them to be strong
meanwhile we found out it was actually
the complete opposite
those who never left africa actually
more faster dominant than those who went
through selective breeding
why again because they still had to deal
with this fuck-ass mosquito
they still had to deal with malaria
whereas the ones that left
because of slavery not as much and the
proof is here
all three of those guys are pure
west africans who are not the centers of
the slave trade
now of course there's a small cultural
element again we all know the story of
francis he grew up working in sand mines
and obviously we know that the poorest
regions in the world tend to produce
some of the best fighters because they
have no other alternatives you know that
to them this is everything so culture
plays a role social economic status
plays a role poverty plays a role
but not as much as genetics and we also
can't forget the fact that other
ethnicities and other races
are also dominating their own niche so
you have whites
who are over represented in strongman
competitions
weightlifting and football you have
hispanics in the lower weight classes
of boxing polynesians in rugby
east africans in long distance running
right so every other ethnicity and race
are also making full use of the
adaptations of their quote-unquote
genetic superpowers
right so it's not surprising that we're
seeing west africans slowly creeping
into fast or dominant sports right it's
all about combining genetics but
obviously hard work
and proper training but keep in mind
genetics are king genetics
are everything you could work as hard as
you want if you don't have the genetics
for sport
your chances of becoming dominant are
very very slim
right so stop thinking it's just
cultural hard work right everyone at the
top level works hard
everyone at the top level takes pds so
when all those things are equalized
genetics are what decide who has the
advantage
same reason why strongman competitions
are dominated by europeans it's not just
culture it's not just that they're more
into it
they're genetically tall and big as [ __ ]
all right so stop using that argument of
black men are in the nfl that's why
they're not a strong man competition
guys less than a thousand black men in
the nfl all right and there are
millions millions of black men out there
right so stop acting like every black
man just automatically
qualifies for the nfl what happened to
the ones that didn't make the cut
if it was that easy they'll just enter
strongman competition and just win left
and right right but obviously that's not
the case
you gotta factor in genetics you gotta
factor in the height the bone structure
the center of gravity the limbs all
those things
that gives europeans an edge in certain
sports
and blacks asians and other ethnicities
on advantage in others
all right you can't have one group
dominating every single thing just
doesn't work like that
but anyway i hope this video answers the
questions as to why
such a small region of africa is
producing so many champions
and trust me there are way more down
there way more guys over there
with insane genetics it's just they
haven't been found yet they don't have
the resources and the money
uh to compete so best believe
as time progresses more and more genetic
phenoms are going to come out of that
region

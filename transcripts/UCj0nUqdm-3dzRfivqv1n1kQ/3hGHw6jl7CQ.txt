next your bra this is very very very
strongly correlated with testone levels
during puberty which is the reason why
men have this crazy BR rid so do neander
those um whereas women don't on average
but after puberty it no longer tracks
your toyone level so I'm going to put
that at okay in fact I tell people all
the time if you want to see somebody has
a ton of testosterone look at their bra
R right especially during puberty men
that have crazy crazy BR rides more
often than not doing puberty were very
very sensitive to testosterone and also
had a lot testone during that time there
no coincidence that you look at most MMA
fighters especially the elite ones that
have crazy braad rides on average is
because during puberty their body was
spitting out testosterone like crazy

hey guys going on here so take a look at
this chart here so this is
four different groups and look at the
change in lane mass
from the low cholesterol group so the
group that ate the lowest amount of
cholesterol
all the way to the group that ate the
highest amount of cholesterol and look
at the difference
in the tangeline mass after a resistance
training protocol
look how much more muscle they built
stop being afraid of dietary cholesterol
guys
a lot of you guys are so desperate to
get shredded that you cutting your fat
intake so low
that even your cholesterol intake is
suffering dietary cholesterol that is
by anyway this is another episode of
science sunday so let's take a look at
this study all right so four groups of
old people
and they each took four different doses
of cholesterol prior to the training
program right so one group took
100 milligrams per day roughly 100 it's
about 150
second group around 200 on the low end
300 on the third group and about 400
uh plus or minus on the high end and the
goal of the study was
obviously see if dietary cholesterol was
gonna have
any impact on the amount of muscle they
put on keep in mind this is a
study on older individuals and the
reason why i like these studies is
because it is very very hard to
for old people to put on muscle right
you guys know they have antibiotic
resistance
so anything that works on all people
and helps them increase uh muscle mass
from training
tends to carry to young individuals as
well in fact there are other studies on
young people
showing similar things as far as protein
synthesis but anyway so let's look at
the results
look at the change in lean mass right
the low end group
as you could clearly see it's a those
response relationships just like volume
right just like volume and training
the group taking the high end put on way
more muscle
than group three group two and group one
and it's not even close
as you increase your dietary cholesterol
intake you increase your increase
in muscle mass from training this is not
new this is not
something that we recently discovered
we've always known that
saturated fat and cholesterol has some
anabolic properties but lately
everyone has been so anti-cholesterol
mainly because they don't understand how
it really affects the body
and if you look at the change in muscle
size same thing right so obviously you
have to change the lean mass
and you'll have to change the muscle
between the very the lowest end
group and the highest uh cholesterol
group
so in case you were thinking well maybe
the transgenic mass is just from
waterway nope
it was muscle and keep in mind
everything else was equated they had
similar calories similar protein intake
uh which was not optimal by the way but
everything was accounted for so same
calories same protein intake same
everything
the only thing that changed was the
cholesterol intake
you can look here the change in strength
right so not only they put on more
muscle they also put on more strength
right
double the increase in strength the low
end group increased their strength by
about 40 percent
whereas the high cholesterol group
increased their strength by about 80
substantial difference and surprisingly
for those of you guys were wondering
well what about the
uh the blood lipids what about the ldl
look the ldl was
the same so even a group that ate a high
amount of dietary cholesterol
look before after right that's the high
cholesterol group in blue
and if you look at the low cholesterol
group before after same thing right no
significant changes
and again we've always known this
dietary cholesterol does not
impact your ldl or your hdl unless you
have a bunch of other issues you know
unless you're like a hyper responder or
you know already have other metabolic
disorders but yet
everyone is terrified of egg yolks
everyone is terrified of
butter and in fact now keep in mind
don't go overboard right you don't want
to overdo it but mainly because you
don't want to [ __ ] up your macros you
don't eat too much fat
because then you're not gonna have
enough calories left over uh to go into
protein and carbs and things like that
but you should not eat those extremely
low fat diets
especially the ones that don't have
enough cholesterol if you look at the
hdl the good cholesterol
same thing look unchanged before after
before after and this is not new this
has been replicated over and over again
eating dietary cholesterol does not
affect your blood lipids
if you healthy if you exercise right
remember there's a reason why your body
makes over a thousand milligrams of
cholesterol a day your body needs
cholesterol for your brain
for your sub membrane for hormones fat
digestion and so many things
so even if your dietary cholesterol is
low there's a reason why your body tries
to make up for that by producing more
cholesterol
and when your dietary cholesterol is
high your body actually produces
less cholesterol to keep the balance
so stop stressing over cholesterol this
is not the 1950s
now why is cholesterol so anabolic well
obviously we know number one you need
cholesterol
to make testosterone it's funny how
everyone forgets that testosterone the
most anabolic hormone in the [ __ ]
human body
is made from cholesterol right without
cholesterol your body cannot make
testosterone which obviously ties into
estrogen without cholesterol there's no
estrogen
so all the positive forget the negative
ones all the positive effects of
estrogen are going
without testosterone and without
cholesterol vitamin d right one of the
most important hormones in the human
body
got citroen your body cannot make that
without cholesterol and even like this
throne which obviously obviously your
body doesn't make like this throne but
even like this one one of the most
anabolic compounds out there
is made from cholesterol you finally get
the hint
right even plants and insects need
cholesterol to make that anabolic
hormone
right and that's not mentioning the fact
that your brain is cholesterol your cell
membranes need cholesterol
a lot of the pathways involved in
protein synthesis including mtor
is affected by cholesterol fat digestion
and absorption
from bile your body needs cholesterol
for that and obviously that's going to
affect your
absorption of fat soluble vitamins so
long story short guys
stop being afraid of dietary so now if
you have some issues because
again i recommend everyone to do blood
work if you have issues with your lipids
your ldl is too high your hdl is slow
then again consult your physician try to
figure out what the issue is like but i
can guarantee you that it's not because
your dietary cholesterol
uh being too high in fact i don't think
most people eat enough
as long as you're healthy as long as you
exercise as long as you do regular blood
work
don't be afraid to get some saturated
fats
and some cholesterol in your diet here
and there now again obviously don't
overdo it
but you get the point now as far as i
must recommend per day
keep in mind those amounts are way too
low remember these were old people
so they were given the cholesterol based
on their
lean body mass you obviously have a lot
more lean body mass than the average old
person so
uh your requirement is obviously going
to be higher than this right
my rule of thumb is always five
milligrams of cholesterol per day
for every pound of lean body mass right
so if you have
a hundred pounds of lean body mass again
i'm just throwing a number out there for
them to make the math easier if you have
100 pounds of lean body mass multiply
that by five then
that's 500 milligrams of uh cholesterol
per day so find out your lean body mass
in pounds and multiply that by five
that's a good rule of thumb

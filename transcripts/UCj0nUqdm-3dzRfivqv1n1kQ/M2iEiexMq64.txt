hey guys what's going on megan here
today's friday so we're gonna do another
episode
of fun fact friday so why
are most of the strongest man in the
world white
right so that's the question that i got
when i made the other two videos on
uh black people and the genetics and
uh polynesians and all that stuff right
so why are most of the strong man right
and when i'm when i say strength i'm
referring to strongman competition not
just power lifting and stuff like that
just
the strongman competition right why are
the majority
of uh strongman competitors why in fact
why are the winners
white so what we're gonna do is first
we're gonna investigate the claim figure
that's true and then we're gonna try to
come up with reasons why
we're gonna explain the reasons why all
right again if you are
missed out on the previous videos check
them out right the first one was on
black people why
why the fastest man in the world uh uh a
black
specifically uh west african descendants
so that includes african americans you
know jamaicans caribbeans all that stuff
right
so i explained that and i also explained
why uh
you know they dominated the bodybuilding
scene so much while the black people why
why the west african descendants build
muscle so much faster
and again it's not all of them is you
know so it's a big percentage like i
said watch the video i'll go into
details
uh and then the second video was when i
explained why um
polynesians and samoans pretty much uh
pacific islanders you know
you know get big so fast you know if you
guys don't know they're over represented
in the nfl
you're 50 times more likely to be in the
nfl if you are
a pacific islander which is insane it's
such a small group of population
you know and i also go into the details
because the rock lucky [ __ ] you
know he's half black
half polynesian so you know he had
inherited a good genes by the way watch
those videos
and in the comment section everyone was
asking well so how come most of the
strong man
are white you know um so first
disclaimer guys on this channel we talk
about everything right so
i know we live in a society where
everybody gets [ __ ] butt hurt and
sensitive the moment you mention race
if you that sensitive [ __ ] off i don't
want you on my channel right we talk
about everything here
talk about race we talk about genetics
you know it's all for science it's all
for fun
nobody's racist here whatever so if you
can't handle those topics or if you feel
like
you know you have a superiority complex
just get lost right i love science
so i don't care what the topic is i like
to discuss it
it doesn't mean that one race is better
or worse than the other no it's just the
results of natural selection
all right let's get to it so
first first of all it is true right the
vast majority of strong makeup editors
are white and in fact all of the
strongman competitors i believe they
have 42 shows since the inception
uh in the 1970s every single winner was
white
now why is that right
very simple so first of all it's they're
not just white right they come from a
very
very small percentage of the european
population right so if you're looking at
the map right here right where would you
guys guess
that the majority of the you know
strongman champions come from
right here most of them come from here
right obviously you have
america because you know it was actually
an american event at first
but most of them come from here it's
mainly nordics
you know mainly uh scandinavians you
know so whenever i say nordic
scandinavia i'm pretty much referring to
you know
again northern europe right iceland fan
land blah blah blah
right the majority of the winners come
from here
now why is that as you can see here
these are the champions by country you
have the united states you have iceland
united kingdom
lithuania finland poland sweden
netherlands norway blah blah blah right
as you notice right and these are all
the champions in in the last 42 events
right all the gold uh
gold medalists which is insane right
because the world is this [ __ ] vast
yet all of the winners of the strong man
events mostly come from here right and
obviously south america so why is that
number one reason is height
right you gotta understand guys one of
the biggest
determinant one of the biggest
predictors of if you're gonna be
successful in strong man is your height
right it's the number one the number one
predictor is your height
in fact uh the average uh showman
competitor
is about six two in fact the average
champion is six two right
which is obviously much lower than the
average person so
they're over here right they're between
five ten and six seven that's where all
the strong man champions are from that's
not a coincidence i'm gonna explain why
a minute
so height is the biggest predictor right
you're not gonna find a strong man who's
five three or five four
a strong man champion that is right um
maybe in the future
somebody will come in and break that but
for now the vast majority
uh you know in this uh in this range
here which is insane
now you might ask yourself why is this
number one the taller you are this very
common sense
right it's basic anatomy the taller you
are the more muscle you can pack in your
frame
right that's reason number one it's just
that simple i mean look looking here
elite priest which is you know
great bodybuilder uh i believe it was
five four five five
um there's only that much muscle you can
put on the five four frame
right and lee priest was huge compared
to the average person you know don't get
it twisted
but standing next to uh you know jay
cutler 510
uh marcus the 510 you can clearly see uh
the difference right does that mean that
these guys train harder than him of
course not right they're just taller the
taller you are the more monster you
could put on your frame
i mean uh i think his competition was
about two to twenty to twenty five
and these guys went up to two eighty
right so you giving up you know up to
fifty pounds of muscle
uh to somebody who's taller than you
just a few inches taller than you right
so
again for strong man that's important
because again the more muscle you have
on your frame uh the more force you can
produce that's just common sense right
so someone who's if two people max out
the genetics
the guy who's sick you know six feet
tall is gonna have to produce more force
he's gonna be able to produce more force
than the guy who's about five feet and
of course you know the leverages come
into play depends on the exercises and
things like that
but for you know the general guideline
is the bigger you are the taller you are
the more muscle you can pack in your
frame so that's why that's one of the
reasons why most of the showman
competitors
are way above average height all right
they can pack up more muscle
the second most important reason is the
lifts right pretty much more than half
of the strong man lips
are hard as [ __ ] if you short right so
being tall gives you a huge advantage
you know for example atlas stones
huge advantage if you you know if you're
tall can you imagine if you like [ __ ]
if you're pegged me from
west africa trying to do this [ __ ] you
[ __ ] right from the start it doesn't
matter how strong you are or how good
your leverages are
so a lot of lifts just simply you know
favor taller people
fingers finger the taller you are the
easier this lift is
the car flip cactus all right can you
imagine trying to do this if you saw it
as [ __ ]
right obviously being taller helps you
here the tire flip
and obviously your carry right because
the taller you are the last steps you
have to take so
there's a lot of movements that pretty
much favor being tall
you know and it's also if you know very
few percentage of movements where
you just can't even attempt themselves
if you're too short right so
those are the two reasons why height is
a huge advantage
uh for strongman competitors and which
is why you know again you know
a hundred percent of the champions are
above average right now what does that
have to do with white people or what
does it have to do with
uh nordic men right scandinavians and
northern europe whatever well look
average height of man by country the
tallest country in the world
is up here right these are the tallest
[ __ ] on earth
right and again country-wise right
because the tallest tribe is actually in
africa somewhere here
uh there's not a lot of men but that's
that's the tribe that's not the whole
country
so as far as country goes the tallest
man in the world
or here northern europe right so right
off the bat
these countries have an advantage when
it comes to producing
uh the world's strongest man for the
strongman competition
and sure enough remember this map this
is where all of the winners are from
see this is where all the strongman
competitors are from and this is the map
of the entire world
there's not a single champion outside of
this rad place here that i shared it for
you guys
and look corresponds with the tallest
[ __ ]
second reason is protein right protein
intake
in case you in case you guys are not
familiar uh one of the biggest predictor
of your height
is the amount of animal protein or good
quality protein you were able to eat
when you were a kid
that's one of the biggest predictors of
your height that's why you know
countries that
you know that have very very low protein
intakes you know kind of like
you know the poor places of india poor
places of uh
africa you know the kids have their
their growth sounded right
amount of protein specifically animal
protein you're able to eat as a kid
is one of the biggest predictor of your
height and of course those countries
are very high on the protein index scale
right they eat a lot of protein so so
that one of the few countries with some
of the highest protein intake
not only like i said not only is
beneficial for height growing strong men
but of course you guys know how
important it is for performance and
strength and just
packing on size in general and sure
enough look here
right out of all the countries these are
some of the countries with the highest
protein intake you have iceland which is
off the charts here obviously you have
america
you know australia but as you can tell
there's no coincidence why
a lot of strong men come from these
regions compared to the protein intake
in africa
or saudi arabia or india blah blah blah
as you can see here that's the protein
index and it shows you the correlation
between
protein intake and height and look you
know i circled some of the nordic
countries where most of the strongmen
come from and look at that right
netherlands sweden whatever
is it by coincidence [ __ ] no right these
are all the countries with the tallest
managers
and it's also all the countries that
produce um other regions that produce
the most strongly
number three money money money money
that's reason number three
the third most important reason why most
of the strong men
come from those regions number one you
guys should know
unless uh especially for those guys
who've never been outside of america
having a gym is a [ __ ] privilege you
go to poor places in africa
poor places in uh india whatever having
a gym is a [ __ ] privilege gyms are
not cheap guys dreams are expensive
in fact in most of the poor countries
they actually have to make equipment out
of scraps and [ __ ] right so
countries that are going to produce
weight lifters and strong man
competitors and power lifters
are places where it's easy to have
access to a gym right
so you got to have a high it has to be a
country with a high gdp per capita
number two steroids right the elephant
in the room of course i want to mention
it right you think these guys are
natural get the [ __ ] out of here right
so massive amounts of steroids that's
not cheap guys you're not going to get
your tests and your dht derivatives and
your
angelon derivatives you know from the
corner store
right you're not gonna find those in the
poor village in africa or india
somewhere right those are very very very
hard to get
especially for people who are gonna be
taking them for years
good health care system right if you
snap your [ __ ] up gotta have a
healthcare
you guys think strongman competitors
don't have injuries you know
or have to do surgeries and things like
that you gotta have a place
or country where you know you have
affordable healthcare
and of course you know these guys get a
[ __ ] ton of calories right
i mean just look at the amount of food
these guys eat in one day
right that grocery bill is off the
charts so you're not gonna have
a lot of poor countries or poor regions
producing a lot of strong man
also it's not a sport that pays a lot of
money right it's not a sport that pays a
lot of money relative to the amount of
work that these guys put in the amount
of money that are spending to training
the the winners you know are not getting
a lot of money especially if you're not
in the top
if you're not in the top three good
goodbye right you're barely getting
anything so
uh the countries that are going to
produce strong men are countries where
you know the gdp per capita is pretty
much high you know it's high enough
where
people can it's pretty much the leisure
sport it's not something that you do to
feed your family you don't say
i got to feed my family i'm going to go
becoming a strong man no right
so so it has to be so you're mainly
going to see strong man emerge from
countries where you know
people can chill people can relax right
they don't mind doing this for fun or
you know for glory or whatever
whereas poor countries not only they
can't afford all this other [ __ ] right
here but
they can't afford to spend that much
money and get uh so little return
you know uh now if you first place of
course you're getting sponsors and all
that stuff but
there can only be one champion right and
of course like i mentioned earlier
protein protein is the most
important macronutrient and it's also
the most expensive macronutrient so
you got to have a lot of money to have a
diet very high in protein especially
animal protein
plant protein is actually pretty [ __ ]
cheap and sure enough where are the
countries with the highest gdp per
capita look for green and dark green
obviously you have the united states and
look here see iceland and all the
scandinavian countries
and as you can see dark green meaning
more gdp per capita than light green
right so once again these guys are
literally
strong man producing countries because
remember you can't just have one of the
factors that listed you got to have all
the factors lined up
next reason they don't have pressure
from other sports
right because you best believe you know
a lot of these guys would have been in
the nfl
right a lot of the talent you know would
have went to the nfl
a lot of the talent would have went to
the nba that's where most of the tallest
guys go
right remember the biggest uh
requirement for strong man is to be tall
well if you're super [ __ ] tall
chances are from a young age you're
gonna be
you're gonna be recruited to play
basketball whether it's for high school
or for college in fact
thor was a basketball player right until
he got injured
same thing same thing brian shaw
basketball player in
high school and college the nfl is not
huge in iceland
if they're recruiting heavily then
almost all of the strong men
will be in the nfl they'll be playing
lion man or they'll be playing centers
in the nba
these are sports that pay a lot more
money uh like i said it's just
the sports are not that big in iceland
and the rest of scandinavian countries
now i'm not saying i don't watch
basketball or they don't watch the nfl
i'm just talking about
uh compared to you know to the united
states it's not the same right these
guys are more into like soccer and
things like that
same thing about usain bolt and why
jamaica produces so many sprinklers i
mentioned that uh
in the black genetics video if usain
bolt was born in america
there's a very very low chance he would
be sprinting right
he'll be in the nfl as a wide receiver
or safety right
that's just facts so that plays a huge
role
and the last reason is obviously the
culture right
remember a lot of these scandinavian
countries they have a lot of viking dna
a lot of them are the standards for
vikings
and um the culture emphasizes strength
and glory and all those things
so that's going to play a huge role in
what people want to be for example if
you grew up in a project so in the hood
right
you say you're a black kid you grew up
in practice you're like hey i want to be
a strong man nobody gives a [ __ ] right
nobody even cares
right because again the culture in those
regions is more you know geared towards
basketball
or football or whatever right whereas in
iceland or
fan land or most of the scandinavian
countries if you say hey i'm a strong
man you actually get props you get
respect you know what i mean for example
walk up to a random america and say name
two strong men not even name two name
one strong man champions from america
they can't even name one right because
nobody gives a [ __ ] right it's not a
sport
that's very very very popular you know
in in america the culture is just not
obsessed with it you know like i said
walk to a random american and say
who is the uh you know name two strong
man competitors
name two strongman champions they're
gonna name thor because of game of
thrones he's very popular
and that's about it you know so culture
plays a huge role whereas you go to
iceland and
you know if you're a strong man champion
you get a lot of [ __ ] respect you get
a lot of credit you know these guys are
you know they put a lot of you know
culture plays a huge role
in uh what sports people gravitate to
and of course you also have to look into
natural selection right
remember guys when the vikings went out
raiding and stuff like that
uh if you were a taller viking you
obviously had an advantage in warfare
you had an advantage in combat
you know especially if you're using axe
or saws or whatever
if you were a total viking you had a
huge advantage meaning higher transit
you passing on your genes higher chances
are you surviving
natural selection kicks in and those are
the guys who went on
raping and pillaging all that stuff
right clapping cheeks left and right
throughout europe
and passing on the jeans so there's
obviously a lot of uh
viking genes at play here by the way
guys you got to play this game
it's a very old game came out years ago
but it's still one of my favorite games
ever vikings battle basketball you guys
know i'm a big history nerd so i study
like almost every [ __ ] culture
out there and the vikings is one of my
favorite cultures some of my favorite
warriors along with the spartans
zulus things like that but yeah um and
also throws my favorite marvel character
but anyway
play this game and i can't wait for
assassin's creed ragnarok is coming out
uh i've been waiting forever forever for
assassin's creed to uh to make a viking
version
uh but yeah back to the video um also by
the way you also gotta watch this tv
show i [ __ ] love this show oh man
ragna i love rock you gotta watch
vikings guys
but anyway so yeah so culture plays a
huge role and that's about it conclusion
why are most strong man from
scandinavian and nordic countries number
one it's obviously height
uh those are the countries that produce
the tallest men uh number two
right very high protein intake uh number
three money
right some of the highest gdp per capita
in the world
uh number four there's no there's not so
much pressure uh too much recruiting
pressure from other
uh sports that that steal away
all the tall and strongest men like the
nfl
and obviously the viking culture right
kind of like high in jamaica if you're a
sprinter you're actually popular whereas
if you were spraying in america might
even lose your [ __ ] name right so
those are the five reasons why most of
the strongman competitors
are white and specifically from
scandinavian countries

hey guys what's going on megan here back
with another video
on top tier tuesday so we're gonna pick
up where we left off
last time we did top 10 human races rank
based on bodybuilding potential which is
just purely
putting on a ton of muscle uh without
gaining a lot of body fat
this time we're gonna do uh based on
strength right producing
as much false as possible and we're
gonna look at you know
not just we're not just looking at
powerlifting guys pilot thing is only
three lifts we're looking at everything
the three power lifting lifts all the
strong man lifts
uh olympic lifting everything so pretty
much the ability to be
as strong as possible now before we get
started obviously i gotta put the
disclaimer guys so if you already know
the disclaimer just skip it go on to the
next chapter
if you're new if it's your first time
watching watch the disclaimer
because i don't want to see your
sensitive ass in the comment section
but for the rest of you guys who have
some goddamn sense
who know that we are all one family and
that no one is overall better than the
other
just skip the disclaimer because i'm
literally gonna just copy and paste it
from last video
disclaimer disclaimer disclaimer if you
easily offended if you sensitive
do not watch this video like i always
say just dislike it
and get [ __ ] lost right it blows my
mind that we live in an area where we
can't even talk about
race and ethnic groups without people
getting sensitive and
people having superiority complexes and
all that [ __ ] okay
to me the difference between people the
difference between populations
is fascinating it's pure biology to me
right humans are just [ __ ] animals
right and just like animals depending on
where your ancestors evolved and adapted
to
that's gonna come with some differences
we all have differences and that's
[ __ ]
fine that doesn't mean one group is
better that doesn't mean one group is
worse
it's so relative it all depends on where
we evolved so disclaimer number one
when i say race i'm just talking about
an easy way to categorize people all
right i don't want to hear you [ __ ]
scientists in the comments section
complaining about racism social
construct shut up right when i say asian
you know what the [ __ ] i'm referring to
when i say native american when i say
black or whatever you know what i'm
referring to it's just a way to quickly
categorize people
at the end of the day we all part of the
human race we just have minor
differences
all right we have differences in muscle
mass speed strength iq
height endurance body fat distribution
you name it it's all biology
right also when i say when i talk about
a race guys that doesn't mean
every single person that falls into that
race that falls into that category is
going to have that phenotype no
it just means on average right so when
we say asians have high iq that doesn't
mean every [ __ ] asian
has [ __ ] 160 iq it just means on
average right
it's the frequency thing same thing when
we say west africans have great genetics
for muscle mass that doesn't mean
every single west african is going to
come out with a [ __ ] myostatin
deficiency i'm west african i have [ __ ]
genetics
whereas my sister has great genetics
right so there are huge variations even
between people and between races right
it just means on average so stop
taking this [ __ ] too seriously and the
last point i want to make is
for people that think genetics don't
play a role in sports and all these
other things get lost i can't stand your
[ __ ] people i think that
everyone can just take steroids and look
like ronnie coleman or everyone can just
train hard enough and make it to the
olympics
[ __ ] off you guys are so [ __ ] and so
ignorant of basic science that it blows
my mind
right genetics play a huge role a huge
role
in performance right there are at least
8 000 genes that are differentially
transcribed
between high responders and low
responders even in basic bodybuilding
even in basic
going to the gym building muscle there
are over 8 000 genes
that are differentially transcribed
between the hyper responders and the low
responders
that's a lot of [ __ ] dreams guys that
means two people can go to the gym do
the exact same training same nutrition
and have
vastly different results same thing with
steroids right
so get out of here with that whole just
train harder and you're going to make it
to the olympic [ __ ]
now again that doesn't mean you should
use genes as an excuse to not work hard
of course right that's definitely not
what i'm saying
but all i'm saying is you cannot
discount the effective genes and just
think that it's all about environment
right it's all about
a combination of genes and environment
if pygmy can train as hard as he wants
he's not going to be a center in the
[ __ ] nba right the average height of
a pygmy is less than five feet tall
good luck with that right the average
samoan
is big as [ __ ] so he's not gonna win a
[ __ ] marathon anytime soon
no matter how hard he trains all right
and last disclaimer is
i don't want to see any [ __ ]
hypocrite in my comment section you guys
want to talk about
the guys who want to blame everything on
[ __ ] systemic racism and
the moment you point out a difference
between races or actually be because
racism [ __ ]
off right you fall left liberal
[ __ ] you know what i'm talking
about
the moment i see something good about
black people that's fine moment i say
something good about any other minority
that's fine
moment i mentioned one good thing about
europeans or whatever
i don't know where oh my gosh systemic
racism i can't stand you guys
you are so insecure that you can't even
give credit with credit but anyway
that's the disclaimer let's get to the
video all right let's get started
also guys remember last time i got asked
so many times uh were
latinos guys know your [ __ ] history
right know your industry
latino's a mix guys you guys are mixed
native american
mixed european and a little bit of
african right west african sub-saharan
african right so you guys are mixed race
right so that's why i put mixed races
here okay
so you have to do a genetic test to
figure out uh what percentage you got of
each right because you could be latino
but
uh you know like 75 percent [ __ ]
european or 75
native american or whatever right so it
varies not all latinos are the same
just like not all white people all
blacks are the same right but anyway
so we have europeans we have west
africans
we have asians mostly east asians
we have south asians we have again the
middle east and north africa i put them
into one group
we have native americans we have mixed
races so that could be black white that
could be
i'm using philippe here but obviously it
could be anyone who's mixed
we have australian aboriginals we have
east africans
and we have polynesians remember guys
how to fit everyone into just 10
groups because there are just way too
many ethnic groups out there even if you
just look at europeans
so diverse africans so diverse
south asians so diversity in india alone
you have so many groups right so
to keep this video short i had to just
pick 10 right how to group everyone into
10 right so don't comment the obvious
as far as wait there's a lot of
diversity between shut the [ __ ] up we
all know
all right let's get started criteria
we're gonna use is we're gonna keep it
scientific as [ __ ] the criteria we're
gonna use
is skeletal structure right so that's
your leverages
uh your limbs your muscle tendon
attachments
center of gravity all that stuff right
second is obviously fast switch muscles
obviously a bigger muscle is going to be
stronger so if your
acne group or whatever is able to put on
muscle once again on average right as
fast as possible that's going to help
contribute to strength
we're going to look at believe it or not
the ability to get fat right the the
bigger you are that's going to come with
some body fat
right there's a reason why the top power
lifters and top strong man are fat as
[ __ ]
right getting as big as possible is
going to help you become as strong as
possible that's also going to come with
a lot of body fat
right body fat believe it or not as long
as it's not excessive helps with
strength
for reasons i'm not going to go into
this video number four we're going to
look at endogenous receptor
polymorphisms again i went into details
in previous videos
and last but not least we're going to
look at the amount of gene polymorphisms
that favor strength believe it or not
there's a ton a ton of studies on that
right there's a lot of genes
that give you an advantage and strength
right and all of these are based on
studies no opinions here
all right let's get started so europeans
you guys should know if you watch my
video on strong man in asia whatever
then i'm about to not category right
especially central europe eastern europe
and scandinavians right skeletal
structure
damn near perfect for strength right
height low center of gravity short limbs
due to bergman's rule and the adaptation
to
evolving in a cold climate leverages you
name it right
not to mention the scandinavians are
tall as [ __ ] so obviously helps them
pack on a lot of muscle mass
that's also the reason why if you look
at the nfl
the positions that require the most
strength it's actually very [ __ ]
close between whites and blacks whereas
the positions
that require a lot of speed are just
dominated by blacks right and i would
explained why
so europeans at the top the only thing
that lacking is androgen receptor
activity blacks dominate that out of the
top five things that i mentioned
they have four they have four of the top
five especially the gene polymorphisms
they have a
ton a ton of gene polymorphisms that
favor
uh strength you know and again those
genes affect different things
tendons ligaments bone structure blah
blah you name it
if you don't believe me do the research
yourself and they're also able to put on
a lot of fat
easily once again adaptation to the cold
next
west african descendants also number
back to not category
but it's only because of four of the top
five criteria
they are able to put on muscle extremely
fast you guys already know i made a ton
of videos about that
the best gene polymorphisms for acting
in three and androgen receptor
sensitivity so again when they use
steroids they blow the [ __ ] up
at much lower doses than the average
person
the only thing that hurts them a bit is
the skeletal structure right that don't
have an
optimal skeletal structure for strength
right europeans have that and that's
mainly because west africans
evolve close to the equator where it's
extremely hot so obviously bergman and
allen's rookie can so
they have longer limbs and more
mesomorphic ectomorphic
body types they also have a very high
center of gravity which is very very
very helpful for running and sprinting
but very bad when it comes to a lot of
power lifting
uh or strong man lifts you want to have
a low center of gravity for that
they also have extremely long limbs
which again great for basketball
great for running bad for strength right
just try to bench press with long arms
see how hard that [ __ ] is
same thing with squats if you have very
long legs god help you
so really the only thing that puts them
up there is their ability to put on
muscle mass
very fast because obviously that's going
to contribute a lot to strength and
their ability to respond
and their sensitivity to testosterone
right give the average west african
descendant
again that includes african-americans
all that give them a small dose of dht
derivative
you know primo master on whatever and
the draw and they get strong as [ __ ]
the downside of that obviously is you
know prostate cancer right because
remember evolution comes with trade-offs
if your androgen receptor is very
sensitive to testosterone
then you're also going to have higher
rates of prostate cancer and sure enough
black people have the highest rates of
prostate cancer in the whole world
there's obviously different reasons for
that too but again i covered in previous
videos
next asians believe it or not even
though they're ranked so low in the
previous video because
that one was just for bodybuilding for
strength [ __ ] amazing
right if you look at the studies it's
very surprising because you would think
they'll be down here right based on
their
uh you know the other things that lack
that but actually very
very [ __ ] strong you guys know what
i'm talking about all right even if you
don't believe this studies just walk
into your gym you're gonna see a skinny
short asian
squatting [ __ ] four plates bench
pressing three plates like
it's nothing and then he just walks to
the waterfall and scrawny as [ __ ] and
you like what the [ __ ]
it's also no coincidence that these guys
dominate olympic lifting
along with russia and stuff like that
and it's mainly because of the skeletal
structure and a lot of polymorphisms
right
they have a low center of gravity very
short limbs
which is great for olympic lifting they
have some high frequencies for gene
polymorphism for strength but not as
much as the other groups
the only drawback is androgen receptor
sensitivity is actually very low
but some of them actually have a lot of
polymorphisms that allow them to take a
lot of testosterone
and still pass the ge ratio test right
so you can kind of put that in there as
well
so they can take a lot of drugs again
not all of them but you know
a small group can take a lot of drugs
and still pass the test right which is
again cheating but
everyone at the top level uses steroids
next south asians guys i'm sorry man
south asians have some of the shittiest
genetics for strength and some of the
shitty units for bodybuilding and again
don't shoot the [ __ ] messenger man
you guys know i got to keep it objective
loving my south asian brothers it's just
man you guys were [ __ ] so many
departments and
again when i make a video in the whole
uh southeastern population i'm gonna
explain exactly what it is it's
all natural selection don't take that
[ __ ] personally guys
and also keep in mind this is south
asians as a group
on average it does not mean that within
the south asian populations you're not
going to find any
very very strong groups no i'm just
talking about on average on average you
guys are [ __ ]
but if you dive deeper of course you're
gonna find a lot of ethnic groups
uh you know that extremely strong even
in india and all the surrounding parts
next middle east north africa [ __ ]
amazing
when it comes to strength and power
output again if you watched the previous
video make sure you watch that one first
you're gonna
you're gonna figure out why uh they're
pretty much the best of both worlds
right they have a lot of genes
uh that stops having africans have and
they also have a lot of genes that
europeans have
um and they also have a lot of uh well a
small percentage of asian genes so
they're pretty much the best of both
worlds right so it pretty much depends
on
what part of the middle east you're
looking at i always say one of the
luckiest quote unquote races or any
groups in the world is middle eastern
guys right because they are
right there in the middle they literally
have uh the most
balanced genetic profile strength muscle
building
iq you name it they're right there in
the middle right and if you look at the
map it makes perfect sense right they're
literally right there at the middle of
so many wars and so many conquests and
you know wanted to go from east to west
so west to east you had to go past the
middle east right same thing if you
wanted to go from
sub-saharan africa uh and follow the
land bridge
into east africa west africa you were
gonna go through the middle east i said
so these guys are some of the luckiest
people on the planet because they have a
mixture of
so many positive adaptations
next native americans believe that not
native americans are bad right
and again it's mainly because of natural
selection right they had to adapt to be
mainly endurance based
so you're not going to fight them at the
top when it comes to putting on muscle
you're not going to find them at the top
when it comes to
power output but they dominate a lot of
endurance stuff
right if you watch my video on boxing
and stuff like that
you know what i'm talking about so
remember if you latino you mix with
native american
european and african right so you're
going to be a mixed race all right next
mixed race i'm going to put that at
[ __ ] amazing but at the end because
once again it depends on
you know what you mix with are you white
black are you european and
native american it depends right so
you're gonna have to do dna tests to
figure out what you mix right if you mix
with some of the groups at the top then
obviously you're gonna be at the top
on average of course if you mix with
some of the ones down here then you know
do the math so mixed race [ __ ]
amazing but
me depending mainly on your on your
parents
but mainly depending on your ancestry
but you'll notice a lot of mixed
[ __ ] are strong as hell i mean
look at larry wills
areas is obviously mixed you know he
definitely has a west african decent
because obviously
he has african-american genes and
obviously you know european because
remember guys african-americans are 25
european which is why i laugh when
everyone wants to be a hypocrite or
racist or whatever it's like dude like
if you're african-american
you have you have 25 european dna
because of slavery and all that [ __ ]
right so you're pretty much european
right you're 25 european all right so
stop being a hypocrite stop being racist
stop
stop being a black supremacist right it
makes
no sense whatsoever yeah it's
unfortunate because of the effects of
slavery and all that stuff the raping
and all that stuff but guys
every ethnic group has an ancestor that
was a slave and i was a king
every single ethnic group i don't want
to go off tangent but
that's why i don't play that tribalism
racism [ __ ] right i don't look at
one race that's better or whatever
because
all of us if you study history all of us
our ancestors did some [ __ ] up [ __ ]
whether you're black or white that
doesn't justify
slavery that doesn't justify all the
evil things that people have done but at
the same time
be very careful when you point fingers
right because everyone has a blood in
their hands
if you go back far enough next we have
able originals they're going to be in a
bad category and again that's mainly
because they had to adapt
it to be a lot more enduring space right
if you look at the hunters and gatherers
in
australia these guys not only they have
to adapt to a very very dry and hot
climate
but if you do a genetic analysis on it
they have a lot of polymorphisms
that allow them to be endurance athletes
and to withstand extreme heat
a bit similar to sub-saharan africans
but they don't have the androgen
receptor
polymorphisms or fat source muscle
adaptations
and myostatin mutations that sub-saharan
africans have
so they're kind of [ __ ] next east
africans pure garbage
my east african brothers stop getting
mad it's like i see them in the comments
section complaining and [ __ ] you can't
have everything
right most east african especially if
you have calendar and tribe dna
you guys are the best marathon runners
and endurance runners
on the planet on the planet and it has
zero to do with culture it's all
genetics because the studies have been
done
these guys are built to run long
distance that is not spreading long
distance
that's why they dominate 90 plus percent
of marathon events right it's not even
close guys there's such a small
percentage of the world population but
if you look at gold medals oh my god
they're
blowing everyone out of the water and no
it's not because they're run to school
that [ __ ] [ __ ] you know how many
poor places in the world have students
that walk and run to school no
the studies have been done these guys
are light their skeletal structure
their vo2 max you can literally go to
the caledon tribe close your eyes pick a
random kid
that went through zero endurance
training bring him to the west
bring him to europe whatever or whatever
wherever you want
train him and in less than a year he's
blowing people out of the water that
have been training for years
right the studies have been done we've
seen that over and over again these guys
are built to run
again i've already made a video
explaining why so i'm not going to
repeat myself once again natural
selection right so you can't have a body
type that is great for running and at
the same time
be extremely [ __ ] strong right
because it's literally opposite ends of
the spectrum
for the same reasons while all the
ethnic groups that are up here that suck
at long distance running they suck
right and the few that are good are
actually outliers
whereas here the few that are bad at
long distance running are the alarms
right evolution comes with trade-offs
guys can't be good at everything
finally last but not least oh my [ __ ]
god
guys polynesians so mainly samoans
people from tonga all that [ __ ] guys
these guys have
the best genetics for strength oh my
[ __ ] guy by the way watch my video on
samoans and polynesia and all that stuff
because i'm going to skip a lot of
reasons why but these guys are built
if you look at the studies if you look
at the research the average
10 year old polynesian and again from
the regions that i mentioned in that
in that video has the strength for like
a [ __ ] 20 year old guy right these
guys are able to get big as [ __ ]
strong as [ __ ] fat as [ __ ] their bone
structure is built for strength
their legs are extremely powerful the
athletic i mean there are
absolute units if these guys started
training for and entering strong man
events or power powerlifting events it
would be
game the [ __ ] over right most of them
are playing rugby by the way they're
playing rugby so we don't really see
them
uh you know participating all these
other events but
oh my lord and once again if you don't
believe me just look it up do the
research you guys know i love studies
man i have
thousands and thousands of studies in my
access database i read this [ __ ] for fun
like on my spare time i literally why
people are watching netflix and doing on
other [ __ ]
i'm constantly digging through studies i
love science i love genetics
to me that's the equivalent of playing
video games right so i have no reason a
lot of you guys do the research yourself
these guys are monsters and they're such
a
small percentage of the world population
right and i already explained why you
know as far as natural selection goes
watch the video it's mainly because of
the [ __ ] that ancestors had to go
through right
but anyway guys i gotta take a [ __ ] so i
gotta wrap this up these are your top
ten
you have polynesians europeans and west
african descendants
at the top [ __ ] amazing you have
middle east asian mixed races
um bad you have native americans
australian aboriginals
pure garbage you have south asians
and east africans but always remember
there are outliers within each group so
you can find
some of the people within this group at
the bottom
and some of the people within this group
at the top right so at the end of the
day it boils down to the individual
level
and who your parents are right so don't
lose hope and don't use that as an
excuse
the best way to finance either get your
dna tested or just [ __ ] train train
and see what your numbers are after the
first two years that's the best way to
figure out
if you have an advantage or something or
not right how much progress are you
making
in the first two years compared to the
average but anyway guys hope this video

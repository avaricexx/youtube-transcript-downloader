drinking coffee or taking caffeine
believe it or not that actually
increases testosterone and also has
anti-arom taste quote unquote anti-rad
properties estrad being the main
estrogen and that tends to happen within
minutes depending on the caffeine dose
of course but be careful because that
also tends to increase cortisol so you
want to make sure that your testosterol
and the cortisol ratio is high and not
low next

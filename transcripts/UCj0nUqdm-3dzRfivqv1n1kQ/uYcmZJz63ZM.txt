hey guys going on megan here so eurasian
countries
dominate weightlifting look at this
chart here and that's all the olympic
gold medals by nation as you can tell
completely dominated by eurasian nations
right europe and asia
now we know that black people are really
good at power sports really good
athletes as
mentioned in previous videos so why is
it that olympic weightlifting is
dominated by eurasians
is it just a participation issue or is
there more to it let's find out
anyway so this is another episode of fun
fact friday
the previous episodes we covered strong
man why nordic europeans dominate
strongman events
why west african descendants dominate
sprinting and bodybuilding pretty much
anything that's fast touch-based based
we went over mexicans in boxing we went
over
samoans and pacific islanders and their
domination of rugby
and pretty much their over
representation in nfl as a percentage of
their population
and the most recent one we did east
africans and um
why they dominate long distance running
so now it's time to focus on
uh people from central europe you know
the balkan region
and obviously going eastward towards
asia as always the disclaimer still
stands guys this video is not for
everybody if you can't take the heat get
the [ __ ] out of the kitchen
this is my channel i talk about whatever
the [ __ ] i want
nobody's racist like i always say this
is just guys
we have the people have the right to be
curious people have the right to ask
questions
right not everyone that has a question
about race or ethnicities is racist
right so if you can't handle these kinds
of discussions or as i always say if you
have a superiority complex and you think
that your ethnicity
your race is better again this channel
is not for you
dislike the video and [ __ ] off you
[ __ ] are way too serious
nowadays
learn to relax and learn to just
appreciate all our differences
another thing i can't stand is the
[ __ ] hypocrisy right i make a video
about blacks
no one complains make a video about
polynesians no one gets mad
i make a video about europeans and white
people oh my god is racist oh my god
it's racist
guys stop being a bunch of hypocritical
insecure
dick bags right why is it fair to talk
about the advantages of certain groups
and not the others right so cut it out
stop the race baiting
all right let's get to it also remember
when i mention race
right i'm talking about different
populations of people right so whether
you want to call it race ethnicity
whatever i don't give a [ __ ] man stop
trying to argue semantic you know what
the [ __ ] i mean right
it's just an easy way to categorize
people that doesn't mean one is better
right it's just easy for me to say asian
to refer to these [ __ ]
it's easier for me to say black to refer
to these [ __ ] here now
obviously we know we could get technical
and you know
talk about genetics similarities but you
know what the [ __ ] i mean right so
anyway
all right quick recap of human migration
you guys know we all come from the same
source and we migrated to different
regions of the world
and due to natural selection we ended up
looking slightly different and we also
ended up getting
different superpowers from adapting
right to all these different regions
it's just natural selection 101 right i
went ahead and created a map of all the
different quote unquote superpowers
that humans developed as we migrated all
across the globe
and like i said one day i might
eventually go over this entire map
as far as natural selection goes i'm
gonna i'm gonna go really fast because
the old subscribers are pretty much
tired of seeing this in every video but
if you're new
create recap of natural selection it
simply means whoever is the most adapted
to the environment is going to survive
and pass on their genes right so all
these mics might be equal right
but depending on the genetic mutation
depending on the difference in colors
different ones are going to survive in
different areas depending on
evolutionary pressures in this case it's
predators
so for example the one here is a better
camouflage whereas the one
the one here is not so you can have an
adaptation that's really useful in one
case but
but completely disadvantages in another
one you have the one here that i made
for birdman and allen's rule
again anyone who evolved in northern
latitudes that's the same for humans and
animals
are gonna have stockier bodies shoulder
extremities such as lames ears tails and
stuff like that right obviously because
you want to conserve heat
perfect example is again europeans and
asians whereas people who evolved in
you know near the tropics you know where
it's really hot
obviously going to be smaller lengthier
because it's a lot easier to regular
heat that way
and of course i did the one about the
gorilla right which gorilla is going to
clap the most cheeks here
uh there's a predator and very limited
resources so he's going to be bigger
whereas here
you know there's a lack of predators and
plenty of resources so
there's less sexual competition all
right so that's natural selection in
nutshell
so back to the topic of the video there
goes all the countries who dominate
weight lifting right so
why is that why do they dominate with
everything and why they're mostly
eurasian countries obviously we have
america here but obviously the white
population of uh
north america european descent all right
so notice on the stand you have to look
at the two lips right you obviously have
the snatch
and you have the cleaning jerk right
these are the two main olympic lifts
now what does ethnicity have to do with
that what does race have to do with that
right
well obviously reason number one is
anatomy right there are differences in
terms of anatomy
when you look at the different races
right when you look at the different
groups for example let's put a black guy
here and a white guy
first major anatomical their friend says
omni right
limps remember we talked about bergman
and allen's rule earlier on average
black people have longer limbs relative
to their body height white people have
shorter limbs brought to their body
right keep in mind this is on average
guys you're always going to find an
exception
again this is mainly because of bergman
and allen's rule
second thing is the legs right black
people have longer legs which obviously
makes them great runners
um whereas uh white people have shorter
legs relative to the height so
and the third major difference is
obviously tulsa right black people have
shorter torsos obviously because they
have longer legs
and white people have longer torsos
relative to their body height which
obviously leads to different centers of
gravity right white people have a lower
center of gravity
black people have a higher center of
gravity right which is really good for
running whereas
having a lower center of gravity is
actually better for power sports you
know such as weight lifting and power
lifting
right same thing with the shorter arms
and shoulder legs very very useful
um when it comes to power lifting and
weightlifting i mean think about that
drastically lowers your range of motion
so pretty much this body is more
optimized uh
for heavy lifting whereas this body is
more optimized for ibc
running again if you watch my video on
east africans and west africans and
uh stuff like that you'll know what i'm
talking about and if you look at the
sport of weightlifting right the two
main lifts
i mean think about it having shorter
arms gives you a
massive massive advantage you know again
the range of motion is shorter
all your leverage is optimized right
having shoulder legs same thing right
less distance the ball has to travel the
second benefit which obviously helps
with the
increase in strength is the neanderthal
genes right remember guys
anyone who is outside of africa has up
to two percent dna from neanderthals
right now you might think well two
percent that's not a huge difference
that is a massive difference guys
remember humans have up to thirty
thousand genes right so two percent
that's 600 [ __ ] genes now they all
have different functions right they're
not all related to strength but you have
to remember guys
neanderthals were strong as [ __ ] right
they were up to five about five to six
times stronger than the average man
again due to the adaptations to the
climate that lived in i mean think about
it guys neanderthals had to evolve here
in this kind of climate very harsh ice
age europe
fighting mammoths and wooly rhinos and
[ __ ]
whereas sub-saharan africans had to
evolve in a very very hot climate of
africa right so completely different
body adaptations
which is once again one of the most
slender fastest
life for the people i found here and a
lot of people who evolve here tend to be
starkier shorter
and in many cases physically stronger
also keep in mind a lot of these
eurasian countries with dominant
weightlifting
also have a pretty good you know actin
and three
uh profile right i'm not gonna go into
details about acting in three i
mentioned in a million times watch the
other videos but obviously west africans
have the most favorable actin and three
um genotype which is why they excel in
fast twitch sports such as sprinting
running basketball things like that
um and and if you look closer you'll see
you have usa blacks here jamaicans here
ethiopians here and look iran russia
china greece right so most of these
countries with dominate weightlifting
you know are not at the bottom of the
list right it's somewhere up here
so that definitely helps them um in
their performance when it comes to
weightlifting because obviously well
everything is a power sport
third reason is the bottleneck events
guys you gotta understand europeans and
asians went through
so so many bottleneck events right and
wipers after every bottleneck event
natural selection right
the strongest survive the strongest
survivor every time and so you have the
black plague
you have the war in fact war is the
biggest
bottleneck event simply because it
filters out the weak like a [ __ ]
right
and if you look at all the continents
look at how much warfare
and you guys know i love warfare i'm a
military history nerd um so alexander
the great julius caesar hannibal barca
all these guys i love studying
right europe has fought so many [ __ ]
wars i mean it's not even close
when you compare it to the other
continents so what happens when you
combine
the constant warfare plus the plagues
i mean whoever survived this entire
ordeal is gonna have better genetics i
mean that's just common sense right some
of the first who died during wars of the
weak now keep in mind that does not mean
that it was not a lot of warfare in
other continents right it's just the
density
is so much higher here and as a result
of this you know that if you're in
european alive today
your genes went through so many
filtering processes
so many bottleneck events right so it's
a lot easier um to pull very good
athletes from this population i mean on
this landmass alone you have the
descendants of the vikings to the north
the macedonians to the south
obviously the castle north as well you
have the descendants of the romans
further down to the south again i mean
just
all the great ancient warriors swept
through this territory
right and obviously passed on their
dreams like i would say right
you have the spartans down here and also
guys remember
europeans are mixed right they're mixed
with mixed with central asians
they makes would have some north african
genetics i mean so they really got
um the best of both worlds right there's
a lot of concentration here due to the
warfare and the trade and things like
reason number four culture right these
guys start very [ __ ] young right
countries like especially russia these
guys start
young as [ __ ] uh china which obviously
dominates weightlifting i might make a
separate video just for china
same thing in this stuff very [ __ ]
young right these guys
are tough as [ __ ] nails and they
actually value weightlifting right
something that actually brings you honor
something that actually
take pride in you remember during the
cold war they were actually using the
olympics
uh you know as a way to compete uh
without using guns right without
resorting to
actual to actual violence so you have to
understand that these nations
actually take the sport very seriously
all right but like i said you know very
tough as nails
on every crew these kids at a really
young age especially
china and obviously you guys know how
[ __ ] tough russians are right i mean
they're notorious
um for how tough they are right same
thing with balkans
so none of that every [ __ ] right i
mean can you imagine trying to put
the stuff that china is doing you know
that they're doing in russia recruiting
kids from a very very young age
um can you imagine doing that in most of
today's societies
cry baby galore right you're going to
get arrested you're going to get locked
up you're going to get cancer you're
going to be like oh my god
child abuse child abuse you know shut
the [ __ ] up right some people are so
[ __ ] weak these days right
you can't even train a kid you know as
long as you don't abuse them right
but you can't even train a kid without
having the [ __ ] pity party
[ __ ] at your doorstep trying to
cancel you
right but these nations they don't give
a [ __ ] right if the kid has the genetics
for it if he wants to do it if he has
the passion for it that train his
[ __ ] young
anyway yeah so starting at a very young
age gives them a huge advantage reason
number five
people always get mad when i mention
this but you are a mad [ __ ] man if
you think steroids don't play a role
in these high level uh elite events
right and like i said it's not just
weightlifting it's everywhere obviously
bodybuilding even sprinting right you
know
these guys get caught doping all the
[ __ ] time
but the countries on the eurasian land
mass especially russia
and obviously bulgaria and things like
that they are notorious
notorious for the steroid usage right
they get banned all the [ __ ] time i
mean for example look here right look at
the top countries
right including china ukraine romania
turkey whatever right look at these top
countries
always getting busted always getting
caught uh on doping violations right
and obviously these are the compounds
that use you know it's mainly it's
mainly the issue derivatives right
obviously compounds that increase your
strength
way more than your body mass right
because obviously you want to stay
within your weight class but yeah they
always get [ __ ] cold i mean guys look
at the map of
uh what map would you think this is
right just just gas for a minute
this is the map of countries with the
most
violations right the ones who got busted
the most and look it's almost identical
to the countries with the most [ __ ]
weightlifting medals
is that a coincidence right now don't
get me wrong almost every top level
sport
uh has athletes abusing steroids right
it's just these guys on another level
right especially russia
remember guys these guys were the
pioneers of early steroid research right
same thing with even like this theron
right these guys were some of the early
trailblazers
so yeah so even though steroids are used
almost everywhere in the world
at the top level these guys are absolute
pros right
there i mean they even have state-run
programs to make sure they have the
highest quality drugs
they do state-of-the-art research and
always try to produce the most anabolic
compounds for the athletes
so that's pretty much reason number five
now of course there's always the bonus
reason like i was mentioning all these
videos right
uh competition mother sports obviously
football is dominated by europeans and
west african descendants
african americans of course nordic's
dominate strongman which is some people
confused with everything for some reason
which is completely different
we talked about how mexicans and latinos
dominate boxing
and obviously soccer soccer is pretty
much mixed right you also have a lot of
europeans
who are really good at soccer we talked
about how basketball is dominated once
again you know it's the fastest dominant
sport
so it's dominated by west african
descendants which is african-american
also has a very high representation of
balkans because it's all the [ __ ] right
and of course we have the other sports
right rugby dominated by
uh pacific islanders and east africans
dominating
all the [ __ ] long distance events
right so that obviously plays a role
um for in which sports uh some of the
shorter slightly less faster individuals
will gravitate to
right you can't have one ethnicity or
one race dominating every single spot
just doesn't work like that right
because again natural selection
unless you have like a monster super
baby was literally mixed with every
[ __ ] thing you could think about
but anyway that's it guys those are the
top five reasons why
olympic weight lifting is dominated by
mostly eurasian countries
reason number one you have the
differences in anatomy reason number two
you have the archaic admixture from
neanderthals
reason number three you have the
bottleneck eventually resulting in a
very very very strong bloodline
the bottleneck events being warfare and
plague
you have the cultural reason such as the
selection processes how early they start
uh the whole nation pride thing all that
[ __ ] and obviously you have
the use of state-of-the-art anabolic
compounds hope this gives you a better
understanding of the differences between
people
and why it's okay to know your history
know your dna know your ancestry and be
proud of it right whether you're black
white asian doesn't [ __ ] matter right
just be proud of your industry be proud
of
you know where you came from as long as
you don't think you better than anybody
else there's nothing wrong with that
like i said we all part of the same
family

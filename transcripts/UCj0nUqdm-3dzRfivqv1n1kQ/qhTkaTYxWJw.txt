hey guys what's going on megan here i'm
so pissed because i actually recorded
this video
and somehow the whole thing didn't go
through so i was talking for like
about 18 minutes like a dumbass just to
find out that uh
it was an epic fail so i gotta do it all
over again so
i'm just gonna speed it up but anyway
chill it's tuesday
uh today's episode is on legs as you
guys requested
best leg exercises of all time rank from
best to worst
uh now of course like i always say there
are no there's no such thing as a bad
exercise right because it depends on
your goal depends on what
what part of the muscle you're trying to
hit you know if it's a muscle that has
several you know several heads uh
depends on your injuries your
your anatomy blah blah blah right so
there's no such thing as a best
exercise or a bad exercise um but for
the sake of this video i'm going to try
to stay objective and pretend that
um we all equal right even though we
[ __ ] not so if all else equal
what is the best leg exercise all right
back to the video
again if you're new to this series
remember we're only using uh pretty much
one criteria which is
if if i could only pick one exercise for
the rest of my life what would it be
right so
so today's episode is on legs to be
specific
it's on quads so if i could only pick
one exercise for quads
for the rest of my life what would it be
right so obviously we're looking for
exercises the
place maximum tension on the quads
while at the same time um lowering the
risk of injury right because
yeah she could put maximum attention on
the muscle but if the risk of injury is
also very [ __ ] high
what's the point you're not going to
last long so maximum tension on the
quads
and obviously makes it easier to
progressively have a little bit because
that's going to be part of maximum
attention
all right so let's pick them at random
uh let's see
uh let's start with the with the machine
press that's that most james right the
machine like price i'm gonna put this
one out okay
all right oh by the way remember the
criteria right i'm about to nut
that's the top of the line top tier uh
best of all time [ __ ] amazing is
right below it okay
you know self-explanatory right average
bad is
nah you know if i could only pay one
exercise it wouldn't be here and get the
[ __ ] out of here it's obviously pure
garbage right
uh again that doesn't mean that the
exercises here should not be used at all
right it simply means that if i had to
only pick one exercise it wouldn't be it
okay so i don't want to see on the
comment section oh i actually like this
section
every exercise has this place but for
the sake of this video
some are gonna end up here all right so
uh the leg press machine i'm gonna put
that okay
right you can't really put maximum
attention on the quads because
eventually you're gonna become your
body's gonna dab and it's gonna be too
hard to progressively overload right
because you just can't increase the
weight on
uh it's very easy to max out those
machines
so if you're a beginner yeah good uh
next we have the leg extensions i'm also
gonna put that okay right
if i could only pick one exercise for
quads it wouldn't be it even though you
know it has its perks
uh for example if you're trying to
target um
your rectus femoris it's a good exercise
right because obviously
your hips are flexed while you're doing
the movement um if you're trying to
target you know let's say
your vast lateralis and you're trying to
have your toes inward and you know
pretty much
it's a flexible exercise right you can
move your toes around
to uh put the stress on different parts
of your quads
uh but again it won't be my number one
exercise if i could only pick one
next you have the 60 squat again back
right even though it's a good exercise
for
maximizing the stretch you know if
you're doing hsp training on your
stretch day this is a good exercise to
maximize the stretch but again for the
sake of this video it has to end up here
because if i could only pick one
exercise for quads
it would not be the 60 squat uh and
again like how are you going to
progressively overload right
after a while it gets to a point where
it's no longer practical
even if you try to put like a weight
vest or uh hold the dumbbells
it's just not practical right so it's a
good movement to start with
but as you get advanced [ __ ] you gonna
do
and i can already see a lot of people
snapping this [ __ ] up from not doing
this correctly
next you have the goblet squat right get
the [ __ ] out here right if i could only
play one exercise for the rest of my
life it will not be the god of the squad
i'm sorry
now when you're doing home workouts you
know your gym is closed and you don't
have a lot of equipment
you know then of course you know it's
going to be a good tool that's why i
said
in the beginning of the video it depends
on the circumstance a bad exercise can
be a great exercise
depending on the situation but uh all
that's constant
no get the [ __ ] out of here next pistol
squat get the [ __ ] out of here right
again it's a very very uh hard exercise
to do right so it really puts a lot of
tension on your quads
it's gonna humble the [ __ ] out of you
you'll be surprised at how hard this
movement actually is
but if i could only pick exercise it
would not be it would not be at the top
of my program
next cycling believe it or not cycling
i'm gonna put this out okay
right depending on how high you put the
resistance people underestimate
uh how much cycling actually activates
your quads if
and i repeat it's a big if if obviously
the resistance is very high
if you're doing regular cycling like oh
no you're just doing cardio right
you're wasting your time but if you put
the resistance as high as possible and
you could barely
uh you know generate momentum then yeah
that's gonna give you a
crazy quad workout try it out if you
don't believe me but
again i'm not gonna rank it higher
simply because you can't progressively
overload right after a while
it's gonna be too easy and what are you
gonna do next you have the deadlift
now again believe it or not i'm gonna
put this out okay right the deadlift
it's not really a quad exercise even
though it activates your quads you know
don't get me wrong depending on how you
perform the movement
um even if you do a sumo deadlift
variation it activates requires to some
extent but it will not be at the top of
the list
right um the tension is going to be
spread out obviously your traps
your mid traps your upper traps uh your
core
your glutes your hamstring in fact i
rank it higher if this was a list for
hamstrings but we're doing quads so i
would not use deadlift as the primary
quad builder i just won't
next you have the bulgarian split squat
i'm also going to put this one out okay
right very good exercise but i'm not
going to put it higher for the reasons i
mentioned above
very very hard to progressively overload
i mean this is a very hard exercise you
can easily snap your [ __ ] up
but it's really good if you're doing uh
again on your stretch stay for hp
training you're trying to focus on the
eccentric
or you're trying to get a maximum
stretch at the bottom very good exercise
next you have uh box jumps again i'm
going to put this at bat right i'm not
going to in fact yeah i'm going to put
this
[ __ ] get the [ __ ] out here yeah i'm
going to do box jumps if i'm trying to
develop quads now
will your quads grow at first yes
at first requires will grow because have
you seen new stimulus but they're going
to plateau really fast simply because uh
there's too much momentum right you're
going too fast uh you gotta understand
guys it's all down to the false velocity
relationship right if you're moving too
fast
then you're not producing as much force
because yes all your fibers are gonna
activate
but you're acting and myosin bridges are
not gonna overlap long enough
uh for them to be put on the maximum
attention that's why you could throw
punches all day
right it's gonna recruit the [ __ ] out of
your shoulders but unless you have
resistance unless you're actually going
through resistance and the movement is
actually slow
because of the resistance you're not
going to build muscle from it so
great for building power but not so much
for hypertrophy
remember for maximum hypertrophy the
muscles have to contract
slowly not on purpose but slowly because
of the resistance
they're contracting too fast that means
the weight is not high enough
it also means they're not placed on the
tension long enough for my human
physiology you guys don't know what i'm
talking about
next you have the step-ups again step
step-by-step
that okay right yeah good activation on
your quads
also activates to shut out your glutes
but it has its limit right
once your body adapts to it it's going
to be very hard yes eventually you can
grab heavier heavier dumbbells but
as my number one exercise [ __ ] though
right
i actually have the lag price believe it
or not i'm gonna put the light press
that [ __ ] amazing
and that's gonna shock a lot of people
because it's such an underrated exercise
you know
the squat is such a great movement that
everyone shits on the leg breasts
but the leg press is very very versatile
first
yes you could put attention on the quads
right it's not going to be as much as if
you're doing squats but
depending on how much weight you're
using and how you executing the movement
you can actually put a lot of tension on
your quads
second your feet right it gives you an
advantage you can't do with squats
you could put your feet closer together
if you're trying to focus on the outer
head of your quads right your face is
lateralis
you could use a wider stance right
so and the risk of injury is relatively
low right you're not going to [ __ ] up
your back
if you're doing the right in fact a lot
of people that have back injuries myself
included
uh were able to fly to this exercise
remember years ago when i actually cared
about building up my legs
this exercise helped me a ton due to my
lower back injury
the front squats i'm about to not no
questions asked this in my opinion is
the best
exercise for quads period period it's
not even close it is the best
exercise for quads
now it has some drawbacks but like i
said the benefits are just
out of this word again if you focus on
quads that is right
and the reason why i place it so high is
because not just from personal
experience because my quads blew
up back then back when i was again when
i was trying to bring up my quads
front squats did wonders until
eventually like i said my lower back got
in the way blah blah
but it wasn't because of the front
squats also it's going to humble a lot
of people right because you're obviously
not going to be using as much weight
uh as back squats but it also shows you
why this is such a good exercise right
most of the tension
is placed on your quads you know which
is which is another reason why you can't
use as much weight because you're not
getting as much help
from the other muscles yes it's going to
hit your hamstrings a little bit your
glutes a little bit but not as much as
back squats
so the majority of the tension will be
placed
where you want it very very underrated
exercise
amazing for quad development next
you have the hack squad i'm gonna put
this one at [ __ ] amazing for the same
reason why i believe the leg press is
great right
so it allows you to put tension on your
quads while also
manipulating your foot position you know
which you can't really do with front and
back squats right you can't put your
feet too close together you're gonna
snap your [ __ ] up
so hack squat very very good exercise
you could put a ton of tension on your
quads
just be careful with your knees because
some people [ __ ] up their knees doing
this
next you have the back squat nope
it's gonna be here that's [ __ ]
amazing actually
this is stuff this is tough this is
tough this is stuff you know what
i'm gonna put this one at [ __ ]
amazing and i'm gonna tell you guys why
yes
the benefits of the of the squats is
that you could put a lot of change
training use a lot of weight it's easy
to progressively overload blah blah
but like i said earlier in the video you
also have to factor in the risk of
injury
the risk of injury is just too high with
back squats you know in my experience
far too many people and i mean far too
many people have snapped that [ __ ] up
uh doing a back squat because again
eventually you're gonna get to a point
where the weight is so heavy
that your back is gonna get hurt because
again we're not perfect yes
everyone does perfect for him blah blah
blah but it's gonna be a day
where you off or you didn't sleep well
or whatever and you make one mistake
and you [ __ ] right you're gonna pull
something in your back
uh your knee it too many injuries were
caused by the squat
on top of the fact that you're not
putting all the tension on your quads
you know it's going to your glutes
a lot of people feel it more in their
glutes uh your hamstrings
you know um so like i said great
exercise
i i still believe it's the king right of
all movements
in fact when i do the the series on
what's the
what's the only exercise i could pick if
i could only do one movement regardless
of the body part guess what squats is up
there right it's definitely
in a in the top five right because it's
a great full body movement
great for putting on mass but i would
not put it at number one
for maximum quad development the reason
i just mentioned right the risk of
injury
the fact that the tension is too spread
out to your supporting muscles
uh but it's still that [ __ ] amazing
which is great right
next you have the barbell and shout out
to ronnie coleman if you guys
grew up watching him uh in his uh
first dvds it was very inspirational i
reminds to watch those all the time
before going to the gym while he was
doing the parking lot lunches
but guess what i'm about to not category
that's right
i'm putting the barber lunch you can do
the dumbbell too
up here and i'll tell you why one you
could put a
ton a ton of tension on you on your
quads
uh with minimum weight you know so that
gives you a
a very long runway to progressively
overload right because trust me you're
not gonna
max out bubba uh or dumbbell
lunges in a short period of time so it
gives you a very long runway for
progressive load
second uh it allows you to hit the outer
head of your quads which i believe is
the most important
third is also a complete full body
workout right just like the squat i mean
this thing hits
this thing activates damn near
everything right your core is engaged
obviously your glutes your hamstrings
um but unlike the squat even though
those other muscles are engaged you're
still putting
the majority of the tension on your
quads like i said it's also a great you
know
glute and hamstring builder another
underrated exercise
that's it guys that's my list the i'm
about to nut front squat
and the lunge right two best
exercises for maximum quad development
followed by the squats hack squat leg
press
and obviously the other squat variations
right i'm trying to keep this less
only 15 so if you don't see a movement
here chances are it's a cousin
of exercises already placed here okay
you have these
right so if you creating a routine are
you structuring your routine make sure
your meat and potatoes come from these
movements up here
followed by these and obviously those
can be you know
they can be added on your uh low
intensity days
all right i hope this video helped stay
tuned for the next one

part you want me to do next

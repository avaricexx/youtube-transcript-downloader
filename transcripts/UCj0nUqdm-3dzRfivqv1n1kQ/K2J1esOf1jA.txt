hey guys going on Megan here all right
let's take a look at this pole and I'm
gonna read the comments the top comments
and answer a bunch of frequently asked
questions all right how much B for red
meat do you eat per day for maximum
testosterone and muscle mass
so let's see who's in the Smiggle
category so 28 of you guys are eating
less than two ounces two ounces or less
of red meat per day by the way red meat
that includes obviously beef lamb goat
whatever
um this is audible 28 let's round it up
so that's a third a third of you guys
are not even eating enough red meat
keep in mind red meat is full of
nutrients I already mentioned that a
million times
um beef has a ton of B vitamins ton of
selenium
um creatine calling a scene taurine
um carnitine
um which is not to be confused with
calling the scene by the way I mean so
many nutrients um zinc
um if you're deficient in Iron most
people are not but iron
um I mean I could go on and on guys I I
just hate repeating myself but if you're
not eating red meat where are you
getting those nutrients let me guess
supplements but anyway
all right so one third of you
[ __ ] in the smeagle category
let's see fourteen percent three to four
ounces
um let's see who's in Leonidas category
so 15 of you guys are getting five to
six ounces
and this actually shocked me this is
actually really [ __ ] good I don't
know if maybe I have a lot of people who
do Carnival diets which by the way I
don't recommend I don't think you should
do any extreme diets
Carnival diet is great because you're
getting obviously red meat you're
getting eggs
um you're getting a ton of
um fatty animal protein which is the
best kind but you're also eliminating a
lot of food groups which I'm not a big
fan of but it's not a video about
Carnival diet but
43 of you guys are getting more than six
ounces of red meat a day
um that's really good it's actually
shocking I think it's the only poll
where uh the majority was in the god
Kratos category this is amazing
um again this is not representative of
the US population this is just the
people who voted that's not even
representative of all my subscribers
because maybe the ones who are the
speaker category didn't want to vote who
knows but this is actually shocking
I'm actually happy
um more people should eat red meat we
would not be in this situation in terms
of the generational decline in
testosterone levels if men took better
care of the diet then you know their
nutrition eating more eggs eating more
red meat eating more beef liver eating
more salmon
always lose you name it you know the
foods that I always recommend
um but yeah guys if you have a diet that
just has if you just eat enough red meat
you'll be amazed just go to chronometer
and put
five to six ounces of red meat right and
you'd be amazed at how much of your
crucial micronutrients you're getting
like I said earlier you're getting
plenty of zinc which is very hard to
find in Foods
um you're getting choline right you're
getting again everything I listed
earlier
from just one food source if I could in
fact I tell people if you could only eat
two foods for the rest of your life in
terms of protein two animals for the
rest of your life
it would be obviously red meat and eggs
I wish there was room for a third one
and then there'll be salmon but if
you're getting red meat and that
includes beef liver
you eating eggs
with the [ __ ] yolk obviously and if
eating salmon those three alone oh my
God you would be so much stronger so
much healthier
every process in your body is going to
be optimizable energy more fat loss my
muscle growth
you know even cognition is going to
improve because you're gonna be getting
plenty of choline and tyrosine for uh
dopamine sentences I could go on and on
right but if you're getting red meat
eggs salmon and then a little bit of
oysters a little bit of beef flavor in
your diet guys you set
you won't need a single supplement
but let's look at the comments all right
let's go my main protein source is
organic grass-fed ground beef I probably
five to six times a week my identical
system is pounding me nice nice
give that a like next the beef prices
and Serbia are a tad bit hard in the U.S
with the average salary
ouch
how much do you worry about you two
thousand dollars per day uh
how much do you lick my nuts per day
right it's always this low Chi guy
that's gonna put an idiot comment
um let's see okay he's not showing what
he looks like obviously all right let's
go uh
see look look at this right a guy who
comes on on a Channel about optimizing
muscle mass fat loss strength confidence
testosterone it goes don't worry about
it just start slow levels probably has
15 nanograms per decily to get the [ __ ]
out of here so 10 pound hand grip
strength [ __ ] all right my mom
consistently Cooks red meat so I'm able
to get four ounces of most of the time
nice nice nice golden mom
um
breakfast
breakfast Steak lunch steak dinner
before bad glass of water and steak uh
this is golden
um I've got it to want me to steak every
day minimum is four ounces nice nice
really feeling but I just need a couple
more eggs olive oil yep yep I've been
for the last four weeks and I felt
better overall nice nice beef that's for
real man eat you damn right
um can we talk in human measurements
like in human measurements like grams of
kilograms guys I wish I wish the the US
was not a
that improved that deck move with the
measurements and pounds because remember
guys when I moved to the US
I came from uh you know from Ivory Coast
which was a former French Colony so we
use grams and kilograms and meters and
centimeters and when I came to the
states not only I had to learn English
from scratch but I had to adapt to the
[ __ ] measurement system so trust me I
also hate pounds and ounces and all that
annoying [ __ ] but I've been here since I
was 11 so
I actually forgot grams or kilograms or
not don't even get me started on Miles
and yards I was like what the [ __ ] is
this the US just had to be different
but anyway
um but I like how he said uh human
measurements uh for once I agree I
actually agree that pounds and miles and
yards and all that [ __ ] is BS
all right uh bison beef cheap
beef chuck of my groceries every week
stressing too much about your chest
levels because you're welcome and oh
look it's that same Low T [ __ ]
see stress the two ah the ultimate cope
it's always got it's like broke guys who
always say oh don't stress about making
money but yet you know every other week
they're asking you for money you know or
they work in a shitty job they can't
stand stressing too much about utility
will decrease your chest levels being a
[ __ ] [ __ ] with loyalty levels
um but I'm pretty sure you
well aware of that already
I'll just be the way of figuring out
east oysters one or twice I mean oysters
are good oysters are good you know
um and you also don't need a lot just
less than an ounce a day you're getting
plenty of zinc and copper and
and I think Selena as well all right
earned these rather small 16 ounces of
lean stickers
another good video you know I was gonna
make a video about this man
um
next I eat about half a pound to a pound
of beef bison uh good day nice nice I'll
see bone marrow
I mean this comes getting better
tomorrow and argument means I can't eat
dude dude
that's what's up man healthy
[ __ ] he's like a man
next dude I'm not reading this whole
[ __ ] but let's see six eggs and US
onions
[Music]
um looks like you have your nutritional
Point
um
I can have live here all right nice
um at least 12 ounces a day if not more
lovely games nice man nice nice nice uh
and guys again steak is not expensive I
explained that a million times red meat
is not expensive if you factor in the
nutrients you're paying for in fact
chicken is more expensive than red meat
if you look at price per nutrient
believe it or not so whenever you say oh
right meat is expensive let me buy
chicken instead
that makes no sense that makes no sense
because you actually overpaying you
gotta eat so much chicken
so much chicken just to get the
nutrients in probably a third of that
amount of red meat
but anyway uh make my girlfriend and I
half a pound burgers really with hella
onions nice nice getting the benefits
from the onions as well so let's see if
you understand whatsoever
nice nice
looks I look like five to six ounces
even when I don't eat red meat
uh for time and cause purposes I don't
have red meat every day have a big
potion once a week two to three sirloin
steaks make up the deficit
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
yeah as long as you you're getting your
eggs salmon you know chicken liver
oysters you're good you're good you're
just gonna have to you know find a way
to open a connector camera which every
man should have by the way and then um
and it's free and I'm not sponsored
about them and just see whatever you're
missing and then yeah I mean if you're
getting egg salmon chicken flavor and
oysters you're good you're good you you
might have to uh now this is where
somebody might have to supplement right
you might have to supplement with
creatine call it a Teen
um you know if you deficient you know
but uh yeah that [ __ ] sucks
I had to Google at once and I had to
Google what ounces and grams not gonna
lie yeah I might have to stop putting
things in ounces and grams for the UK
[ __ ]
um let's see but I live in a country
with a cheap access to what me like
there but nice nice see this is what man
evolved to do to hunt for red meat for
meat
we're not always successful but the ones
were clapped the most cheeks and passed
on their dreams
you guys have no idea how much
um anyway I don't want to go off
changing I so much red meat I was
suspended from YouTube when the egg pole
was on and the 86 to 12. it was just
from YouTube what did you do bro
86 or 12 eggs a day you know I could
nice I mean guys the I'm glad you you're
writing this even those Atticus won but
there's so many studies debunking the
whole cortisol I mean cholesterol and
egg made for people still
um people still believe it people still
believe that eating a lot of eggs are
gonna [ __ ] up your cholesterol or
whatever you know especially if you're
healthy like what but anyway when I did
have really high cholesterol which
caused by too much cardio
all right 12 ounces of red meat five
days a week nice nice holy [ __ ] beef and
steak has the most noticeable
Improvement especially for me and it
actually does it actually does
um a low-fat vegan
I'm a low-fat vegan and my test is 31
nanomorph a liter and I said 35 years
old okay um
cookie
um and equals one if that's even true
but uh you know assuming United you're
not on TRG I would say that's impressive
but again that's usually testosterone
that's not your overall Androgen status
we don't know what you call it so it's
like we don't know what your feet is
like we don't know what your DHEA ass is
like we don't know where you are
uh intracellular and intramuscular dhts
like there's so many things that go into
antigen status then just assassin levels
but
whatever works for you as long as you
have the symptoms I mean the signs of
high testosterone fine but I can show
you people with very high testosterone
and they have
all the symptoms of low T because of the
reasons I explained earlier but whatever
works for you do whatever works for you
if eating
if eating ass cheeks makes you anabolic
whatever just do it you know like I
don't care to me I'm all about showing
you guys the studies based on my
experience what the literature shows
you know what works for most people
doesn't mean it's going to work for you
find my works for you
next uh all right so I think I might let
me see
um
non-vegetarian right here being nicely
vegetation oh God oh God
ah guys does this pros and cons to
everything man I mean you could apply
this logic to everything but
um oh love your videos okay I was about
to flame it all right all right I love
you too bro thank God I click show more
um but yeah I mean if you want I can
make separate videos about how to
mitigate the downsides like I said it's
downsides to everything everything this
down starts to drinking water guys and
and water is a social life so
um
let's see
for us as a bison prices of glass would
be nice like man you you bison any
[ __ ] you guys are so lucky uh
hunt nice nice over there for lunch
it's epic let's see
kangaroo meat is is so golden but
obviously it's not accessible to
everybody if you ever access the
kangaroo horse meat oh man
bison
doesn't this depend on the individual
absolutely it depends on the individual
depends on your genetics depends on how
your body responds to the food depends
on
on your contacts or your buck and you
cutting whatever it depends on so many
things you know these readers are just
general advice
um you still have to like tailor it to
your goals and your needs
um let's see I use grams
that's too long

you need some jasmine rice or oras MTI
rice that's how you call that [ __ ] you
need a measuring
cup you need some olive
oil you need some salt you need some
pepper all right guys show you guys the
way I make my very quick probably what
15 to 20 minutes max anyway first thing
you want to do is you want
to see you want to you want to hit this
[ __ ] up right don't worry about the
stove I know it's [ __ ] dirty unless
you going to clean it shut the [ __ ] up
so put the fire on low or medium right
uh grab some olive
oil that's the way we do it there
there's many ways to make rice all right
many ways it's just the quickest way for
me put a little bit of olive oil down
there
right next
I
measure one cup of
rice put it in
there then what you want to do is you
want to mix
the the rice with the oil so it doesn't
stick this way later on you won't have
to worry about rice um sticking to the
pot keep doing that until the rice
changes color meaning until it turns
white I mean it's already white but it's
not really you see what I
mean I don't know if they could see like
it's already s to change color no they
can't see they can't see
oh it's not my [ __ ] problem when it
starts to look like crystals yeah yeah
there you go there you go [ __ ]
see it's start the change col so just
keep waiting keep doing that till you
notice the rice is start the chin color
once you start the chin color you want
to
actually add the water otherwise going
to it's going to go from white to
Crystal to Black and you don't want that
all right so now that you see that the
rice is coated with the olive
oil we going to go into the next
step [ __ ] man I'm always dropping [ __ ]
every video I
make now my rule of thumb is for every
cup of rice I put two cups of water but
you also got to use your eyes you got to
look when you put the water you want to
blast this [ __ ] up right you want to put
it as high as
possible so one more cup of
water what you want to do is you want
the water to be at least an
inch above the the rice [ __ ] it just
going to throw it in yeah so one cup of
rice two cups of water
and you want to turn it all the way up
now you want to add your salt and
pepper little bit of
pepper tiny bit of
salt come on [ __ ] there you
go now usually I do
this throw a little bit of soy sauce in
there but just a tiny bit cuz yeah it's
a tiny bit just like that just for that
little that little soy
flavor once you do
this mix it up a little bit cover it up
and let it
boil you still playing all right guys
when the when the water's boiling we
should take about what 2 minutes 3
minutes you want to reduce the flame as
low as possible what I showing the [ __ ]
off all right so this
low put the lid on
top boom that's it wait your rice is
done okay action all right guys look
after 10 15 minutes I didn't count uh
the rice is done that's all you had to
do this how simple it is this how easy
it is to make rice literally
so remember I'm not being a dead ho just
watch the video rewind I say
te King me

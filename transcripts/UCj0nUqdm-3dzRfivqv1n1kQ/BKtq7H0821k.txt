hey what's going on megan here why
is so important to increase your protein
intake when you're doing full body
workouts right
why i always recommend higher uh protein
intakes
especially again it's especially if
you're doing full body workouts right
now years ago i used to recommend it but
obviously it was just based on pro
science and common sense
but as i always say the science
eventually catches up to the bro science
right
and now we have the literature is pretty
much clear that
if you're doing full body workouts right
again this is something that should be
common sense but
i guess it wasn't so common at the time
uh if you're doing full body workouts
you need to increase your
your protein intake if you want to
maximize muscle growth and i'm going to
show you the difference
i'm going to show you the as always the
link is going to be in the description
the study is going to be in the
description
i'm going to show you exactly what
happened uh in this very very
interesting study video so you had two
groups of people
right group one group two group one
train and obviously uh took 20 grams of
whey protein whey protein isolate
um and group two same workout program
full body workout right
and it took uh double the amount right
so 40 grams
and this was the response in uh protein
synthesis
after the workout right now it doesn't
look like a lot
but this is actually huge right i think
the p-value was 0.005 which is
insane and the difference was 20
now to put that in perspective 20
increase in protein synthesis
is massive guys it's huge uh again
an example is testosterone if you inject
um
very high doses of testosterone and you
don't train at all
right the amount of muscle mass that you
put on from the obviously from the
increase protein chances whatever
is roughly 20 to 30 percent right so if
i'm not training at all if you inject
very high doses of steroids
obviously you're going to build muscle i
mean that's the reason why people that
uh
um that do what is it called you know
that change their genders and right
when they start injecting very high
doses of testosterone
they build muscle even without training
you know same reason why
same reason why testosterone was
invented for patients that were
bedridden and couldn't move you know
like
burn victims whatever uh so the reason
why they build muscles because protein
sentences goes up but how much
guess what 20 to 30 percent obviously
some people you know outliers there
that would go up by like 50 um and
some are low responders
you know their protein senses will only
go up by about 10
but that's to give you an idea of how
how much 20
is is huge you know it's enough to
literally change your physique
uh through the use of steroids so
the group that that uh that took 40
grams of whey protein
got a 20 increase in protein sentences
relative to the group that obviously
took you know took less and this goes
back to what i was telling you guys
years ago go watch my videos
about full body workouts i mean
literally around i think 2013 or 2014
and so forth
and i kept explaining you know you
cannot expect to train your entire body
in one workout session
and expect to uh and pretty much eat the
same way or the same amount of food as a
person who just did a you know
chess and triceps it just doesn't make
sense and hit and i gave the example
here and i excused my bad drawing
i drew this on one note really fast and
made a copy of it so you have two guys
right
um and obviously one guy does a split
routine does chess and triceps
right on monday whatever and the other
guy does the full body routine
and obviously these guys obviously i
drew these guys voided out of their
 minds but
i had to overemphasize the body part but
anyway so the split routine guy
is stimulating his chest and his uh
triceps right for the most part if
you're doing chest and triceps
his chest triceps obviously front delts
uh whereas the full body workout guy is
doing
chest he's doing uh shoulders biceps
triceps back
quads you name it right um which is
obviously one of the reasons why
uh you grow so much faster on full body
workouts i'm not going to go into the
details i i beated that house about that
years ago but that's one of the reasons
you're stimulating so many muscle groups
in one session
that everything goes up the anabolic
response goes up your nitrogen retention
um goes up so you can't expect this guy
right to have the same protein
requirements as this guy it just doesn't
make sense right
remember how protein synthesis works
right muscle building is protein
synthesis it's your body
taking the amino acids from your diet
right and
rearranging them in order to to uh you
know to build muscle tissue you know
muscle treatment out of protein right
so you can't have protein sentences
without amino acids from your diet right
and you can't expect a guy who just did
chest
and triceps right only stimulated about
you know very small percentage of his
body
to have the same protein requirements as
this guy it just does not make sense and
that and that was my rationale years ago
you know but of course you know how
people are there was no studies at the
time that they were like oh this is bro
science blah blah blah blah and now we
see the results right
i don't know if you guys are familiar
with the literature but uh it was well
established
that uh you didn't need any you didn't
need more than 20 to 25 grams of protein
to maximize protein sentences right
that's what
the literature that's what everyone all
the experts quote unquote believed at
the time you know they were like hey
you don't need more than 25 uh grams
post-workout but guess what that's those
studies were done on people who trained
splits they only did like you know their
legs you know leg extensions or squats
or whatever
right and now we finding out that if you
do a full body routine
that 20 to 25 grams of protein is no
longer enough
to maximize uh muscle growth
which is common sense you know i
told you guys you got to use common
sense you can't always
uh uh listen to the quote-unquote
experts with things that know it all you
know just use your brain right i
mean look at that 20
increase in protein sentences right so
that's one of the reasons not obviously
not the only reason but that's one of
the reasons why i always recommend
higher protein insects
uh for on full body workouts if you want
to know why uh if one of the other
reasons obviously check out my video on
protein intake where i go into all the
details the science the mechanisms
it's not just for muscle growth it's
also for body composition blah blah blah
but very interesting to see that the
science eventually catches up to the
process like i always say you know same
thing with nuclear overload
it it's always going to catch up you're
recruiting more fibers
right you're also burning slightly more
calories i mean just so many
so many things point towards uh
increasing your protein intake
and your caloric intake um when you
obviously training more muscle groups
and you have so many people who switch
over from full body from place to full
body
but keep the eating the same right i'm
like guys like what are you doing you
know
um you always your recovery management
always has to match
your training load your your workload
right you can
increase your volume increase your uh
your energy expenditure increase the
amount of muscles you're recording in
a workout session while keeping your
nutrition the same it just doesn't make
sense
right so anyway without making this
video too complicated or too sciency
i can make it longer if you want but
most don't watch the long videos
so
i'm gonna cut it here so pretty much
long story short if you're doing full
body workouts
increase your protein intake right and
that's just one reason why your protein
intake should be
you know should be high on fbw there are
a boatload of other reasons
i mean like i said i always rather eat
slightly more than i need
then too few anyway i hope this video
helps
i know i should work on my drawing
skills but i got the point across

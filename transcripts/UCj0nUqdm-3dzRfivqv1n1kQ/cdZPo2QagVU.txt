hey guys what's going on megan here
seven reasons the coronavirus
will actually increase your muscle gains
not directly of course
but bodybuilder of the day is tom
platts the goat the legend the one who
revolutionized
what a mr olympia caliber
lag development should look like let's
get straight to it man i feel bad for my
man goku straight to it
resetting your mtor that's the number
one reason the number one benefit
of everyone being home and not being
able to you know obviously go to the gym
if you haven't reset your i'm tall in a
long time now is a great chance to do it
and you guys you know i was going to
mention it if you've been watching my
videos for a long time
you already know what mtor reset is long
story short
mtor is the main enzyme involved in
protein synthesis you know building
muscle
you have two phases of protein genesis
you have dna transcription that's when
you actually go to the dna
and you know get the genetic material
copy it and you have dna
or in our case rna translation that's
mto that's when you actually convert
the genetic code into actual muscle
tissue mtor
is the main enzyme responsible for that
i'm not going to go into the details you
know to write or something all that but
pretty much
mtor is responsible for protein
sentences
the problem though is that if you've
been training for too long
amateur becomes less and less sensitive
that's your body's way of stopping you
from getting too slow
like i said i know that's crazy because
that's all we want is to get bigger and
bigger
but your body hates that [ __ ] so usually
around four to six weeks after training
amtos starts to desensitize right
and the only way to reset that switch as
you guessed it is to stop stimulating
him charge
stop training take a break from the gym
and watch my
several videos on the topic if you want
me if you want more detail
but another thing that down regulates uh
you know the longer you train is your
androgen receptors
right that's another thing that your
body does to stop you from getting too
big
how do you reset those again you guessed
it take a break that's why in nucleus
overlord i recommend you guys
to train for four to six weeks take a
one to two week break and then go back
to the gym
so this is gonna give you an opportunity
to reset your mtor if
again if you haven't done that a long
time also it allows your joints to
recover from all the heavy lifting and
all that
now if you already been subscribed for a
long time you've already been resetting
your mto every four to six weeks
um and again keep in mind guys you're
not gonna lose your gains i've explained
that a million times
the nuclei in your muscles does not go
away right
so all the satellite cells that donate
nuclei to your muscles they're not going
to go away
right if you reset your i'm tall you
might lose a little bit of size but the
moment you go back to the gym
not only muscle memory is going to kick
in but because your mto is so much more
sensitive now you're actually going to
grow faster than if you're not taking
that break all right
so don't freak out next
pump training and i have a whole video
on this coming up it's going to be one
of my best videos ever because
it's again it's one of the most
underrated thing in the fitness
community
um people took it way out of context and
think pump training is just you know
some fluffy doing the size
nope like i told you guys years ago it's
actually more critical
to your muscle growth journey than you
actually thought right
again it's going to help you maximize
cell swelling right
you're going to put water into the cell
you're going to maximize igf-1 and
mechanical factor production
you know you're going to maximize lactic
acid and a lot of people underestimate
the power of lactic acid
when it comes to building more so that
burn is not just
you know a byproduct of training that
you can just say no no it's actually
crucial
right and more and more studies are
coming out ever since i made a video on
high rep training and you know why the
pump is important
more and more studies are coming out
backing it up guys bodybuilders have
known this
for decades right lactic acid helps with
testosterone production
they've done studies where there's shown
that if you introduce lactic acid to the
latex cells which obviously your
your testicles um you actually get more
testosterone production
than if you had used luteinizing hormone
which is your body's natural way of
obviously
stimulating tea production you're gonna
get increased igf-1
obviously and there's a theory that you
might even get more igf-1 deaths because
remember rgf1 that is 10 times more
powerful than igf-1
right at activating satellite cells and
protein sentences
but igf-1 that's is a shorter version of
igf-1 right
so you actually have to make some
changes to the igf-1 molecule in order
to address 1des
and it tends to happen you know in
acidic environments
so again that's one benefit of lactic
acid is it greatly increases
you know the conversion of igf-1 to
hydrogen that's uh it increases
saturation like i mentioned it lowers
myostatin yes
lactic acid improves your myostatin the
phallus line ratio
and obviously like i said earlier it's
an asthma like right it puts water into
the muscle cells
so pump training is so so underrated
and and that's the study i'm going to go
into detail in one of the next videos
the muscle thickness you get after
training meaning right after you finish
working out right that pump you get
studies are finally showing that the
correlation between a thickness
that that just that crazy pump you get
you know like the
the increase in muscle swelling right is
actually more correlated with
hypertrophy than the strength gains
from training let that sink in because
remember i made a ton of videos about
that right
stronger is not bigger progressive a
little being i'm misapplied on that [ __ ]
more and more studies are backing us up
guys so when you finish a chest workout
or full body workout
the bigger your chest so the bigger your
arm whatever body part you're training
and i'm talking about right after that
training session just that temporary
you know pump effect that cell swelling
effect is more correlated with how much
muscle you're gonna put on
in the coming weeks than your actual
strength gains over time
that is insane and the coalition was
tested
as high it was from i believe 44 as high
as 60. so that means about
30 to 35 percent of the muscle gains
you're going to put from your training
workouts
is actually more related to the pump
then your extra strength gains again i'm
going to go into details when you know
when i make that video it's going to
blow your [ __ ] mind
all right so again so that gives you an
opportunity to do pump training at home
next gal aesthetics again another thing
that's very underrated in the fitness
community
people [ __ ] sleep on calisthenic
exercises guys
dips for chests and trials pull-ups for
your last inverter rolls for your
runboards that make traps
handstand push-ups for your desks upper
traps upper packs
guys those are great ways to stimulate
hypertrophy you and again another reason
why people sleep on calisthenics is
because of the [ __ ]
you got to get stronger to get bigger
nonsense that i've been bashing for the
last eight years
right so when you tell somebody hey do
dip so do pull ups they're like oh
i'm not i'm not gonna get too strong
doing that so i'm not gonna build muscle
like what the [ __ ] man
those are some of the best exercises you
could do for hypertrophy and of course
they have their limitations but
don't think that just because you're not
getting you know a
[ __ ] 100 increase in your bench press
by doing dips that it's not going to
carry over but again like i said watch
my video on
showing it's not bigger in my video on
progressive overload uh it's not the
driver hypertrophy watch that video i
know it sounds [ __ ] crazy but i got
all the data
to finally back it up next nucleus load
this gives you an opportunity to do
nuclear silver load again at home on
your lagging body parts
one thing you could do with side
laterals first of all you know my
programs i recommend satellite rules you
should be doing style errors every day
there's no reason why you should do side
laterals on monday and wait till the you
know the monday after that
or the weekend to do it again right your
shoulders recover extremely and i mean
extremely fast
they're slow towards the dominant
there's no reason why you should let
you know at least three days go by
that's why most nighties have shitty
side deaths it has nothing to do with
the androgen receptors it's just
we don't train muscles that's freak when
they were supposed to train them
especially the slow twitch muscles
like shoulders and forearms and caps
right so it's a great opportunity for
you to just do
nucleus overload on your lagging body
parts you can do push-ups if you have a
lagging chest again pull-ups
you could do dumbbells skull crushers
you don't need a lot of weight for those
um so again take advantage of this
opportunity uh to obviously prioritize
your lagging body parts
finally got soup actually not fun i
think i have another one
bracket blood flow restriction training
again if you watch my videos i've been
talking about this for
years almost 10 years now right it is
more effective
than regular strength training at
building muscle i repeat
it is more effective than regular
strength training
at building muscle and this is proven
there are so
so many studies on blood flow resolution
because it works with them well it works
in young people
untrained trained enhanced natural
you name it right not only you get more
muscle growth
in some cases you get equal but you get
less injuries
less stress on your tendons less stress
on your joints you name it
much more effective and it's more time
efficient it's just painful as [ __ ]
you also get more type 1 growth again
more satellite selectivation less
injuries
uh and that's the downside though is you
do get less strength which is another
reason why i kept telling you
[ __ ]
that stronger does not mean bigger you
build muscle do
you build more muscle doing blood flow
restriction training but you always get
less strength
every single study that compared regular
training you know
basic progressive overload and all that
[ __ ] you know putting more weight on
the ball blah blah blah
and [ __ ] uh uh blood flow restriction
training
the group that lifted heavy always put
on more strength always 100 of the time
but the group that they blow for
restriction put on more muscle and in
many cases
equal amount of muscle which tells you
that the correlation between strength
and size is
horrible and i've been beating the dead
horse over there for sure
so many years people didn't want to
listen then and now the studies are out
and people are still not listening but
oh well
again this does not mean that you should
not progressive overload watch my video
while i go into more detail
it does not mean you should not
progressively overload
as i explained in that video progressive
overload is gonna happen
it's a byproduct of training nobody
benches 135 pounds for 10 raps
and comes back a year later and it's
still doing that way no you're gonna
automatically get stronger you're gonna
go to the gym one day and you're gonna
realize
holy [ __ ] i could do 12 reps now you can
do 12 reps
you're gonna come back a few weeks later
and realize holy [ __ ] not gonna do 15.
right so as long as you train hard with
a high enough rpe
and you always come in close to failure
you're gonna progressively overload you
you can't help it it's part of the
natural process
but anyway another thing that's gonna
happen is
you'll be able to train twice a day
first of all i'm not going to talk about
full body workouts
if you're not doing full body workouts
by now after all these years that i've
been being a dead horse over it then i
can't help you
um again nothing wrong with push-pull
nothing wrong with splits whatever but
if you want to maximize
muscle growth watch my videos on the
topic you should be doing for body
workouts by now
but it's going to give you an
opportunity this break to do it twice a
day right as long as you do short
workouts you combine everything i
mentioned high reps
blood flow restriction all that [ __ ]
you'll be able to train twice a day
and studies on people who train twice a
day especially the ones who do cat suits
twice a day
so that they actually put on more muscle
than if they only trained once a day
right and it's very short the workouts
are extremely short less than 20 minutes
so you could do it twice a day
and you got to stay the half-life of
most of the anabolic hormones is very
short
igf-1 and mechanical growth factor have
a very short half-life
it's between 12 to 24 hours the longer
you've been training obviously
the shorter the half-life um i mean the
shorter the anabolic response so
training more often is always more
optimal sleep
that's the last thing take advantage of
this break a lot of you [ __ ] got sent
home you don't have to work anymore or
maybe you work from home take advantage
to sleep more
and i'm also going to make a whole video
on sleep because that's another thing
that's so basic but yet so underrated in
the fitness community
sleep is king guys it's not a
coincidence that that's when your most
anabolic hormones are released
growth hormone testosterone you name it
you need to sleep it's also not a
coincidence
why babies when they are growing right
that period of their life when they're
growing the most
all they do is [ __ ] sleep that's not
a coincidence right
sleep and growth go hand in hand people
in prison
one of the reasons why they're so jacked
apart from steroids and then training
all them day whatever is
all they do is [ __ ] sleep you got to
recover guys that's why
all my comments whenever you ask me a
[ __ ] question i'm always going to
mention the word recovery
it all depends on your recovery so sleep
nutrition all that stuff so
take advantage to sleep a lot more right
maximize your hormones maximize your
recovery
right and sleep is also going to help
you with you know dopamine for those of
you who are not aware
dopamine is a neurotransmitter that
seems that's pretty much regulating your
motivation right your desire to seek
pleasure
right and your dopamine receptors are
downregulated when you don't sleep
enough
and it's going to lead to you having
again low energy low motivation
you're going to overeat you're going to
start taking drugs and [ __ ] addictive
behaviors you name it
all right so that's it guys again to
perform those workouts very simple just
buy yourself a dip station
uh pull up bar dumbbells bluff
restriction band it should cost you less
than two hundred dollars probably even
less than that
and training at home if you're doing hsp
training just do the pee exercises only
right hope this video helps let me know
what you think about tom class
i still think he's one of the goats he's
definitely not in my top 10. i put him
in the top 15
simply because his legs was really
what's what stood them apart

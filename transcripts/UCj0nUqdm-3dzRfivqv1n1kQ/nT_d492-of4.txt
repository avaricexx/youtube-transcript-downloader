hey guys what's going on megan here
alexander carolyn
the most feared wrestler of all time
absolute
legend those of you guys who grew up
watching wrestling i'm not talking about
wwe wrestling even though i was addicted
to that too i'm just talking about
olympic wrestling
greco-roman style you guys know who this
guy is
absolute legend 887 wins
and only two losses the most ridiculous
record in fighting history let that sink
in for a moment
887 wins and two losses
come on guys these are some video game
stats
and make no mistake about it he was a
genetic
[ __ ] freak anyway this is another
episode of
what the [ __ ] wednesday which is the
series when we go over genetic freaks
people who have over developed body
parts have
my style mutations or people who are
very very high responders to steroids
in the last episode we went over the
georgian giant so make sure you check
that video out
and in this one we're gonna go over the
legend himself the russian
freak of nature now quick disclaimer i
don't want you guys in the comment
section arguing about steroids right
it's the most annoying [ __ ] ever we all
know
99 of these guys at the elite level are
using pd's
but even among those guys some of them
are genetic freaks
not everyone responds to steroids the
same way guys just like not everyone
responds to training the same way you
have low responders high responders you
have some who have more
satellite cells than others you have
some who have less you have some who
have high interest in receptor
sensitivity
some who have less right we're not all
the same despite what all the [ __ ]
labels want you to believe
there are genetic differences between
people right not everyone responds to
training the same way
and not everyone responds to steroids
the same way some people can train and
look like this some people can train and
look like that right
so enough with the steroid [ __ ]
right there are at least 8 000 genes
that are differentially transcribed
between high responders and low
responders 8
000 genes that's the [ __ ] time guys
that's why two people can get on the
same program
same diet same everything and get
drastically different results
right so if you're born a pygmy where
the average height is less than five
feet
don't try to be a center in the nba
that's just not gonna [ __ ] happen
right so enough of you guys who think
that if everyone works hard enough
they're all going to become
elite athletes so if everyone takes
enough steroids we are going to become
elite athletes it doesn't [ __ ] work
like that but anyway
let's go back to the legend let's pull
out the vegeta scouter get some info on
him
name is abish alexander carolyn the most
dominant man in the olympic wrestling
history
he was about six three and he competed
in the 130 kg category so about 286
pounds he was born in russia
and i already made a video about these
guys especially the slavs the eurasians
some of the craziest genetics come from
there especially when it comes to
strength
watch my video now if you haven't
already and obviously
as mentioned before he's an olympic
greco-roman wrestler the greatest of all
time and make no mistake about it
he was a genetic freak to give you some
perspective
the average weight of a baby is about
seven pounds obviously
with the standard deviation being about
half a pound right so that means 68
let's round it up 70 percent of babies
are gonna be between
six point five and seven and a half
pounds ninety-five percent of babies are
gonna be born
between this range here meanwhile
alexander was born weighing about 12
pounds some sources say it was a lot
more than that but people like to
embellish it
it was about 12 pounds right so that
puts him right
here right a [ __ ] god among men
i mean just let that sink in 99
percent of babies fall within that range
and this guy was born
not here not here not here but here
heavy ass [ __ ] baby came out like a
straight kryptonian i don't even know
how the [ __ ] his mom pushed him out
so for you guys who think genetics don't
play a role good luck explaining this
what are you guys gonna say he was
taking train when he was a [ __ ] fetus
but anyway so oh and keep in mind i'm by
no means saying that this guy's netty
i'm not [ __ ] [ __ ] this guy's from
russia
who are notorious for doping the
athletes but as i mentioned before
it doesn't even [ __ ] matter because
this guy would have been walking through
the competition
with or without steroids it's funny
because you have two gruesome people
right you have the ones who think that
steroids don't do anything and they just
give you a little ash
which is obviously [ __ ] steroids
give you a huge advantage and then you
have those
who think that everyone who gets on
steroids becomes [ __ ] superman right
i think anyone who injects enough
steroids you know can get on the rfbb
stage and compete against ronnie coleman
which is obviously not the case right
and both of these guys are completely
wrong steroids give you a huge advantage
over a natural person but remember
steroids just enhance your genetic
potential so if you have [ __ ] genetics
steroids make your genetics less shitty
if you have great genetics
steroids simply enhance that all right
so stop attributing everything to
steroids but anyway
another crazy thing about alexander was
that not only he was born weighing over
12 pounds
but at age 13 he was 5 foot 10
weighing over 170 pounds so let that
sink in obviously not this picture here
he's obviously not 13 here
this is not a [ __ ] anime but yeah 174
pounds
5 foot 10 13 years old complete
behemoth and he was undefeated for
13 years straight let that sink in at
the elite level someone competing
both at home and internationally at the
elite level going
13 years without a single defeat
in fact he went six years without his
opponent scoring a single point against
him
i mean this guy was straight out of a
[ __ ] comic book
and to give you an idea how strong he
was he was mainly known for the reverse
body lift right which is pretty much him
picking up his opponent
and slamming them on the ground as if
their lives meant nothing now keep in
mind guys
he was in a 130 kg category right so he
was
picking up grown ass man remember the
reverse body lift was mainly done
in the lower weight classes of
greco-roman wrestling right no one was
really doing that in a heavyweight
classes simply because
guys were just simply too heavy he said
[ __ ] the rules
and actually made that one of his
signature moves
i mean i don't know if you guys ever try
to just think think of what happens when
you try to pick up your drunk friend
right
dead weight extremely heavy to pick up
off the ground now imagine that
weighing 130 kilograms on top of
resisting so imagine trying to pick up
your drunk friend
which once again you guys know how heavy
it is to pick up dead weight but i
imagine that that weight is actually
resisting being picked up and this guy
still managed to pull it off
over and over and over again so many
people have no idea how hard this was
i mean he was just [ __ ] terrifying
just look at this shot here look at his
face
it's like [ __ ] demon mode activated
he looks
[ __ ] possessed look at this guy's
[ __ ]
i can stop laughing these pictures like
you shouldn't pick up a grown man like
this
they even named the entire lift after
him here's another shot as you can see
he's crazy build
his forearms you guys know wrestlers a
wrestler's grip
is [ __ ] unheard of these guys are
extremely powerful for arms
and this was when he lost i mean i was
so [ __ ] pissed as a kid because he
lost to
gardiner who looked like he just [ __ ]
ate potatoes for a living
and it was such a huge upset now as far
as james go why was he so [ __ ] strong
guys remember
europeans already made a video about
that but europeans have a lot of genes
or i should say have a higher frequency
of genes that are mainly associated with
strength not power output strength right
remember if you watch my video on
on west african descendants they have a
lot of genetic polymorphisms that are
mainly related to power output right so
fast tourist fibers
building muscle at a very very fast rate
things like that right speed
whereas europeans tend to have a lot
more gene polymorphisms that are
more geared towards strength for example
they have the highest frequency of the
hif1a gene
ppr gamma the gl ntl6 gene
which is obviously involving protein
metabolism one variation of the rgf1
gene
blacks have a higher frequency of
another version of this gene but anyway
the mln gene
the active and 1b receptor gene that's
part of the myostatin and active in
pathway the mprip gene which is
obviously involved in actin mouse and
binding
the clcr gene the epas gene you guys
already familiar with this one i covered
it before
the rc3h1 gene which is obviously
involved in mrna degradation and immune
system
and they have a pretty decent actin and
three profile that's the only one where
they're not over represented in they
don't have the highest frequency of the
actin and three that's obviously for
sub-saharan africans followed by
iranians and russians
but i put this up there because they're
actually pretty high compared to the
rest of europeans
when it comes to acting in three but all
these other genes you see here and it's
a lot more if you guys want i could make
a whole video on every single gene but
all these genes you see here
are mostly responsible for strength
output and
europeans have the highest frequency of
those whereas west african descendants
and a lot of sub-saharan africans mostly
have the highest frequency of
power related speed and mostly
hypertrophy jeans and by the way back to
the acting and three thing i was talking
about as you can see
west africans at the top followed by
jamaicans usa blacks
iran is very [ __ ] high and then you
have east african blacks and there goes
russia like russia is pretty up there
when it comes to
the acting m3 profile and as i said i
already mentioned why that is once again
europeans and asians have the highest
percentage of neanderthal genes
and they're also adapted to the brutal
climate of eurasia and you can also see
more proof of that in the nfl right you
guys remember this chart that i went
over and if i break down my race in
position if you notice
the fastest positions in the nfl
completely dominated
by west african descendants as you can
see cornerback 99.4 percent
wide receiver safety any position that
mainly requires speed and power
you're going to see a lot of west
african descendants whereas positions
that require a lot of upper body
strength you start to notice that
white people start to pour in tight end
tackle god
center or even quarterback i mean
throwing power keep in mind the nfl just
cares about money it's not like back in
the days where they didn't allow blacks
to play or whatever they just care about
who's the best athlete for whatever
position they're trying to put them in
but anyway without making this video too
long let me know what you guys think
about
alexander do you think there will ever
be another wrestler like him
or do you think he will remain the
greatest wrestler of all time

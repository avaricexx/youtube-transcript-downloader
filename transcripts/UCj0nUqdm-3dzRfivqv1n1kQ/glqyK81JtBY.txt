hey guys what's going on megan here so
one of the questions we got last time
was how many sets do you need obviously
in one session to maximally reduce my
statin levels right so obviously if you
guys remember this graph this is all the
relevant studies that show the effects
of different training protocols on my
statin from the training protocols that
reduce my standard lease to the ones
that reduce to the most and obviously
you guys also know that training is by
far
the best way to reduce my stand
naturally of course but then the
question arises how many sets how many
sets do you need to get that maximum
drop
anyway this is another episode of my
staff monday where we discuss everything
related to my statin or its number one
enemy phylostatin now as always the next
chapter is going to be a recap of
everything mars satin does and the most
recent literature on it so if you're
already familiar with that and know
everything there is to know about my
stat
skip the following chapter if you knew
then i consider you watch it all right
so long story short my statin is a gene
it's a protein that your body makes and
its job is pretty much the limit how
much muscle you could put on right if it
wasn't for myostatin we will all walk
around like the [ __ ] hook right so
that's four main things
it stops protein synthesis
it increases protein breakdown it lowers
satellite cell activation
and it makes you insulin resistant which
obviously leads to less muscle more fat
so pretty much it makes your skinny fat
phylostatin on the other end it's
another protein that your body makes and
it does the opposite of myostatin right
it stops myosin from activating its
effects to its receptor it also stops
active in a so this is the most anabolic
molecule
in the human body phylostatin
even more anabolic than testosterone in
fact testosterone's effects are mainly
mediated through phallus that
here are some examples of what happens
when your myostatin levels are too high
for example the reason why your legs
shrank when you put them in a castle you
immobilize for a long time is because
myostatin levels go up the reason why
hiv and cancer patients lose a ton of
muscle so fast is also because the
myostatin levels go up
and the reason why astronauts lose a ton
of muscle mass in space is because once
again when you go into space in a low
gravity environment my stand also goes
up right so my stand is the bad guy
if your goal is to maximize muscle
growth
here's an example of a rat at the bottom
here this is the control right this is a
normal ride and this is the rat that was
genetically engineered to over produce
phylostatin and to also lack the
myostatin gene so as you can see that's
the biggest rat we've seen in in
research four times the amount of muscle
as a regular rat right so and once again
normal levels of testosterone normal
levels of antigens it is so massive it's
not even funny and here's what the rat
looks like when it's actually alive
straight bradley dwarfing the other rat
and this is lean muscle as well
extremely low levels of body fat this is
the monkey that was injected with
phallus style as you can see here
this is before the injection this is
only a few weeks after the injection
about three months after the injection
absurd amounts of muscle growth
and this is the 10 year old kid who is
lucky enough to be born with a myostatin
deficiency once again he has normal
levels of testosterone completely natty
but look at his physique at 10 years old
right
his parents were freaked out it brought
him to the doctor and yeah his he's
healthy perfectly healthy normal levels
of androgens didn't even go through
puberty yet yeah he has more muscle than
the average grown ass man once again
this is what happens when you lacking my
myocyte or you over producing phylostat
and again the reason why professional
bodybuilders look so [ __ ] huge is
because one of the main effects of
testosterone is to interfere with the
master and pathway mainly by up
regulating father statin or increasing
the activity of the rgf1 pathway
several studies also back this up as you
can see here one of the most important
transcription factors in fact the most
important transcription factor for
muscle growth is accurate one you can
see here the correlation is 0.999 which
is in short the most important
transcription factor for hypertrophy and
sure enough my satin blocks this gene
so you want to put on gains you have to
down regulate myostatin you have to
lower my stat another study shows the
same thing the correlation with the
amount of gains you put on after
training and your ability to lower my
statin is negative point 82 which is
massive
my statin is also the reason why old
women put on a lot less muscle than
young men or old man after training
mainly because they have a hard time
lowering my statin even when they're
trained as you can see here old man have
a big drop in my stand after training
young men have the biggest drop in my
style after training which is why again
young men put on muscles so fast
young women decent drop but old women
struggle to lower myostatin which is why
they struggle to put on muscle mass
and several other studies confirm this
as you can see here
one of the main reasons why women cannot
get as big as man even if you inject
them with testosterone is because their
myostatin activity is way too high
myostatin is also responsible for
insulin resistance so if you have a dead
bod you skinny fat you have that tire
around your belly well
chances are you have very high levels of
myostatin next myostatin is also the
reason why those will train with full
body workout so with high frequency tend
to put on muscle so fast because the
dropping mice and after training
only lasts for less than a day right the
drop peaks at the eight hour mark and
then slowly after that my stand goes
back to baseline right it goes right
back to [ __ ] up your gains so that's
why those who train more frequently
it's just full body workouts nucleus
overload tana put on muscles so fast
right they're constantly keeping
myostatin down regulated smile stand is
also the reason why people will
supplement with creatine tend to put on
more muscle it's not just the other
effects of creatine it's mainly that
creatine also
is a very very powerful myostatin
blocker as you can see here
this is the drop in my stand from the
group that trained with our creatine and
this is the drop in my stand from the
group that trained with creatine huge
drop
and lastly
that's the reason why the world
anti-doping agency
ban every
single agent that drastically blocks my
stat or increases file style but if you
want to lower my stand you're gonna have
to do it naturally and i have a ton of
videos on that i just watched the
playlist
all right so back to the question how
many sets do you need in one workout
session obviously very simple guys the
same amount of sets that you need to
maximize muscle protein genesis remember
building muscle is simply
maximizing increasing net myofibrillar
protein synthesis right you obviously
want protein synthesis to be high in
protein breakdown so if you already know
how many sets you need to maximize
muscle protein sentences in one session
then that's all you need to know because
that's all that matters right at the end
of the day all we care about is
maximizing this right right
rna translation aka protein synthesis
right remember all of the noise in the
fitness industry you know the research
articles and all the biology textbooks
all of the noise when it comes to muscle
growth simply boils down to one and two
okay dna transcription rna translation
that's it right everything boils down to
this so if you know what maximizes
myofibular protein sentences then you
also know
how hard you have to train
to maximally lower my statin right
because it doesn't matter how much you
lower my stand if it doesn't translate
to protein sentences and from almost all
of the research that is out there
it seems to be about five heart sets
which is why i always prescribe five
sets in all my programs i don't care if
it's nucleus overload hsp training right
somewhere around five sets give or take
right depending on your genetics your
training status all that stuff is where
you maximally maximize my fibular
protein genesis mso activation igf-1
mechanical growth factor activation
p70x6k the entire pathway that leads to
you building bigger muscles seems to max
out somewhere around five heart sets and
i have to say hard steps because
obviously the effort that you're putting
into every set counts right if you're
doing 10 sets
but it [ __ ] sets you're obviously
wasting your time right so somewhere
around five or hard sets right as you
get closer to six seven eight sets
you're just getting getting far more
fatigue far more muscle damage relative
to the return that you're getting on
muscle protein synthesis
and this is the same in rats
and in humans
you don't need more than five heart sets
per muscle group to maximally lower
and the maximum increased protein
sentences right and keep in mind this is
referring to one session right in one
day because remember the biggest drop
you get in my style tends to be around
the eight-hour mark
after that right within a 24-hour period
it starts to go back
to [ __ ] your [ __ ] up which is also
why in almost every study out there
especially on trained men
the muscle protein sensitive response
after training
usually goes back to baseline around the
24 hour mark some people less some
people more if they have a lot of muscle
damage
all right so i hope that answers that
question five heart tests per muscle
in one workout session is all you need
to maximally drop my stat and mrna and
activity
for at least the next 24 hours alright

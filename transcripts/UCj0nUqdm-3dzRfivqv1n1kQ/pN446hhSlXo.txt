hey guys going on Megan here all right
next Quiz age lowest testosterone it's a
natural process is this true or false so
I'm gonna give you guys the answer and
then we're gonna go to the comments and
see what everyone else is saying
the answer is false yes so 64 percent of
you [ __ ] have this wrong
because you've been lied to by goddamn
everything right
um age does not lower testosterone
directly it is not a natural process
there's endless research on this
debunking this myth right it's the
things that men do as their age their
lowest testosterone see this lie was
perpetrated by the lie that age Lewis
testosterone it was perpetrated by the
trt industry as usual big farmer because
when you have a product this is business
101 you have a product that you want to
sell you have to create a need for it
right so the TLT industry which is now
almost 2 billion dollar industry right
around 1.6 1.8 billion and it's been
booming ever since that life started
they go around spreading that myth
challenge man hey by the time you hit 30
by the time you hit 25 30 35 you know T
levels drop with ages nothing you could
do oh but look there's trt and you guys
fell for this [ __ ] it is such a lie I
mean I could go into the other reasons
why they wanted to spread that lie
um but most researchers around the world
most studies
debunked that a long time ago age does
not lower testosterone it's just one man
age what do they do think about guys
what lowers testosterone
stress uh reducing fat intake so
reducing cholesterol intake
um having kids having a wife
um I've already Mr stress uh being
sedentary
competing less chasing attractive women
less right
eating like trash and think about it
when man age what do they change to do
they compete less right they have a wife
they get kids they get stressed out
they're more sedentary because they're
making more money on average right they
eat less fats because the doctor seldom
egg so bad for you you're gonna get a
heart attack they get put on statins
that lower their cholesterol I could go
on and on
it's not age that Louis how do we know
this simple there's ton of studies
showing old men in their 40s 50s 60s was
significantly higher I'm not talking
about outliers just old men that are
very healthy take good care of their
bodies that have significantly hard
testosterone levels than not only other
old men but then young men who eat like
trash in fact I already made a video
about these guys well at one point 65
year old man at least 65 year old man
had about 1100 nanograms per day
testosterone and a young man on the era
had about 1200 which is nothing because
the standard deviation of testosterone
is about 300 nanogram per deciliter so
that had virtually equal T levels
despite a 40-year difference in age
any study was also confirmed by other
studies in different countries where old
men have to be active just like a young
man because they're in third world
countries and things like that or in
Hunter Canada trials where the old man
have to hunt and they all have the same
key levels as young men
and showing up the old man we get
married and we get kids the two levels
start to go down because they're more
sedentary they're more stressed out but
lack then goes on and on so I mean if
you guys want I could literally show you
guys over 50 studies from different
researchers confirming this
age does not lower T levels the things
we do we actually do even if
even in in
circumstances where the the men's
testosterone level is lower because of
oxidative stress and damage to his
statistics again that's because that
damage kind of accumulates with age if
the person is unhealthy
when you reverse the damage t-levels go
back to their youthful state
but look how much all of you guys drank
the Kool-Aid of the GLT industry and
believe that 30 of the body just decide
that's there's a reason why men could
have cases at 120.
let's read the comments see what
everybody else is saying but yep 64 of
you guys uh believe this myth but it's
not your fault because
because every idiot every [ __ ] even
well-known uh influencers and scientists
was seen as you know uh experts are
spreading this [ __ ] myth you know
because once again they want you to join
the Dark Side I want you to rant your
masculinity from a bottle all right
let's see the comments I avoided yes
knowing that it's the Trap crushing and
you're going to roast us later in the
video yeah I mean this is
to be honest to me I don't even find
this humorous anymore because this is
just sad to me you know it's sad to me
that so many people believe that look at
this that means 64 of the viewers of 5
000 men
um believe that you know after a certain
age they'll have to hop on trt because
it's a natural process when it's
complete [ __ ] you know
and it's also an excuse for people to
just let their bodies go to waste and
abuse their bodies not take care of
their health and then when the tea
levels go to [ __ ] they're gonna be like
oh look I mean it must be because I'm 28
no [ __ ] it's because you're not
disciplined but anyway
um I read a lot about this because I had
a regular reading my 40s that my female
doctor said was normal uh it's hard to
know what studies to believe
um but the best I can figure is that
it's natural for loves the climate age
but not to the degree we say today I
love to know your thoughts yeah yeah it
is not natural at all like I said if you
want I could go over every single study
that actually debunks this it's not one
you guys know I never took a stance
unless this [ __ ] amount of evidence
right I never ever took a stance at
something because I saw one study or two
or three or even five to me even five is
not enough because that's not enough to
do a decent meta-analysis I need dozens
and dozens and dozens of studies
that's the reason why I've read over
forty thousand I'm picking forty
thousand as a minimum because I actually
average 10 studies a day for the last 10
years
um actually more than that
if you want to be technical but bare
minimum is 10 a day like me reading 10
studies a day that's like a bad day it's
usually 20 30 sometimes it's 40
depending on how much coffee I took and
how much time I have
so I've read tens of thousands of
studies on every chapter you could think
about to start Endocrinology not just
testosterone
um obviously hypertrophy because you
know one of my life's biggest passion uh
Neuroscience Behavior anything that has
to do with the human body physiology
Kinesiology so and I could tell you what
extreme confidence
that there's more studies proving that
this is a myth in Islam right the few
studies that are saying oh look old men
have lower T levels they do not equate
they do not control for the things I
mentioned earlier such as how many kids
they have or they marry you know do they
smoke blah blah blah you know are their
body fat is nothing you know men can
increase body fat as they age and sure
enough we all know body fat destroys to
start swing by at least 50 percent
you know depending on how big show of
course
um so yeah yeah it's a it's a complete
lie like I said watch defeated I did
showing the 65 year old man that had a
hundred that Eleven Hundred tea levels
and the 25 year old man had about like
1200. which is nothing you know the
standard division is 300 so that's not
statistically significant
the difference that is but anyway
um let's see uh I have no clue of age by
itself or lower T but I'm sure it's in
the Bible correct Bingo the byproducts
of Aging
um but that's again that's not an excuse
because I could show you man I got I've
been coaching for a decade I could show
you old men because I coach young men
old men and Natty guys people on the
juice I can show you old men who are
older than older you [ __ ] I
have two levels of 89 but that's a
leader free just starts rolling above
160 around 180 popular gram per
milliliter DHT close to 80 to 90.
nanogram per desolator I can show it to
you guys you know
so it and I also can show you the young
man that I'm coaching that have half of
the tea levels of some of the old guys
you know and sure enough what are the
old guys doing they're taking care of
their health they're they're exercising
a lot of them are single sure enough you
know
uh but again that's a topic for the
first video I could show you guys how
you know having a girl and kids is is
kind of you know again you've heard of
you girl right it has a lot of downsides
and one of them is depending on the
situation which I explained in the video
it could crush your teeth levels a lot
so my daughter was born in less than a
few months Matilda was got like almost
halved
I remember they went from like it was
above 1200 when she was born and it went
down to 576 570 something I'll never
forget that because I was like holy [ __ ]
in less than a few months and I had
barely changed my habits I was still I
mean I wish I was sleeping that's
because I was stressed as [ __ ]
um but you know I was still going to the
gym that was back in
2012. yeah I was back in 2012. I was
still making videos
ABS six-pack muscles everything and then
just having a kid
and at the time I was like oh it was not
Placebo either because I tried
everything in my power to someone that
was from going down that went from the
high 11 High 1200s to 576. just from
having one kid I imagine the guys who
have two kids three kids I can't sound
excuse because there's still things you
could do to bring them back up but it's
um but anyway uh yeah Tess doesn't
replace the ages the things you're doing
Bingo let's go [ __ ] Sigma Legend
right here
um he did his homework as age increases
everything goes I think it does a little
bit not as much as the medical industry
make it out
um the slow recover from exercise at uh
after your 20s yeah see
yeah so when I can make a video about
that so testosterometer go down but some
other things go down like DHEA
um obviously three age but
um but again yes it's not as drastic as
people make it out to be
um and it's like saying somehow
demanding if she doesn't even go down
now there's also issues with ssbg sex
homo binding globulin going up as man
age
um and astrodog going up as well but
again it depends on how healthy the the
old man is and things that I could
mention is completely separate videos if
you guys want because then it gets very
technical I have to stop mentioning the
High Roller T3 and you know all the
other things but anyway the older you
get the heights are supposed to be the
older boys who hit true needs to wash
your face again correct
um hey Megan should do a video on the
best types pod nut you mean of nuts how
to oh okay with the best time spawners
and how to eat them to do with fighting
acid I already answered that in a
Discord and I've read it so many times
but sure
um your Great Grandpa probably have four
times the tea you have a 2160 correct
you know again there's so many studies
showing this [ __ ] had over a
thousand like it was nothing you know
and so enough if you go back and you
look at their lifestyle one they were
hard working they were getting played in
the sunlight they were eating update
sorry they were eating healthy but
something that was not eating healthy to
them they were just eating normal food
you know butter eggs steak you know um
fish every now and then cod liver oil
you know being out in the sun they're
not sedentary all day they were
literally doing the basics that I keep
preaching in every video
you know you go back to you go back in
those days and you you tell them you
know hey do you know what a healthy diet
is yo look at you like wait what dude
like this is what we eat every day you
know especially Farmers or Farmers where
it's so healthy because again they got
eggs they got milk which is goated for
testosterone don't let nobody I can't
wait to make a video destroying the myth
that's not circulating about milk being
bad for testosterone give me a [ __ ]
break stop listen to retards milk is
amazing for testosterone oh
I can wait till I smash that myth the
estrogen in mug is so insignificant that
you have to drink 30 to 40 000 calories
worth of milk in one day to even have an
ounce of significant estrogen not to
mention that milk also you know what I'm
going off Gentry let me come now
um you guys really gotta stop listening
to retards man we don't know what the
[ __ ] they're talking about all right I'm
looking forward to this video brother
it's going to be based um see I wonder
if it changes I got pissed what was I
saying yeah Farmers Farmers eat very
healthy they eat a lot of eggs
um
butter obviously red meat occasionally
drink a lot of milk and yeah they had
super high tea levels
let's see avoided Falls and keep in mind
also the quality of the solo is a lot
better back then
not necessarily this 90 of those that
definitely have rt there's some guys in
20s absolutely absolutely and even
studies for this so this is not like oh
Theory this is completely true
um some Studies have shown that age is
bad for you and then some people die you
should do your best not to do it
a good one he literally did a video
covering I appreciate you always kidding
I stay on that bee fish avocado kiwi
blueberries of water dinosaur discovers
yeah yeah eat healthy right you know
it's funny that like you know this is
revolutionary you're telling people to
eat healthy but yeah
um stop [ __ ] up your balls man guys
just one junk food I could show you the
study showing one bad meal can do draw
you to level by like 25 percent
25 that's a lot 25 for one meal that's a
lot uh and that's just one bad meal you
know from the inflammation the oxidative
stress the the endotoxins you know
especially if you have gut health is
trash uh all the poofers and see those
you guys are eating you know all the
lead paper oxidation just
wrecking Havoc
just wreaking havoc in your body all
right it's important to be old but don't
have to eat too I think you wrote a new
girl right
I think it's lifestyle correct most of
the muscular and strong people I know in
the mid to late 30s I'm pretty sure
there's something about using something
over two decades children's amazing and
the best living internet uh yeah yeah
Megan's gonna disprove Cloud Sanders age
related
uh you should do a video about
vegetables and benefits I'm pretty sure
I did I did a checklist for almost every
food group you could think about
here's the answer I think an age number
in itself hold on let me see what time
let's see how long is this video oh God
all right let's hurry up
um
like eating sugar yep yep yep you would
pick then go a little lower from that
point you get them in chain in maybe
after 8 seconds
the average amount of discreet as the
age is because the average man has a
[ __ ] lifestyle yeah everyone has a
shared lifestyle
um fapping drinking junk food whatever
let's see um I don't know about the
fapping part but I've already beat a
dead horse over there uh yeah but it's
not the main cause a little test uh
too much
oh [ __ ] but this guy
um
it does just Anonymous people make it
out you're gonna see many nine year olds
over that was made for healthy matters
to correct
um
Tesla was beginning going up at puberty
and stuff you high still doing like 80.
what happens is that Peak at puberty and
they just stay flat so in healthy men in
also in countries where older men are
just as active and just as healthy a
younger men what they've noticed is that
t levels go up during puberty to like
again let's say over a thousand whatever
and it just stay there until the guy's
like [ __ ] 80 90 doesn't matter they
just stay there matching his lifestyle
now again if he has kids and has the
stress and blah blah blah then of course
they start to go back down but the old
man who are literally living like young
men they're [ __ ] boys and they're single
and they're they're competing they're
you know getting sun and sleep whatever
the T levels just stay right there
where they were we know around puberty
and in fact the young man who eventually
have a shitty lifestyle or whatever tend
to have loyalty levels and the same old
guy to show you about
you know guys just read don't don't just
hear something oh don't even take my
word for it right study all these things
I'm telling you guys are free and
accessible to the public now some
studies I have to pay for because I'm a
nerd like that but most of them are free
you know
and read as many as possible don't just
read one or two and be like oh look this
study said that most studies are
correlational studies so they suck ass
right that's why you have to read so
many studies on just one topic before
you make a conclusion right because most
studies are actually correlation you
know just oh saturated fat is associated
with heart disease and then you find out
well yes because people who eat a lot of
saturated fat tend to eat a lot of fried
foods and you know put a bunch of
vegetable oil in the shed or tend to
neglect fruits and veggies you know and
that's what's giving them hard issues
but see but most idiots would you see a
study like that and go oh look stop
eating saturated fat and then end up
having low tea and a bunch of other
issues
you cannot just look at a study and say
oh look it says this so ah but anyway
maybe I think I might make a whole video
showing you guys how to read how to find
interpret studies but you have to know a
little bit of Statistics you have to
know a lot about biochemistry so biology
and chemistry
um you have to know a lot about
Endocrinology obviously not just one
hormone like this last one you have to
know you know your thyroid system
you have to understand your entire
endocrine system you have to understand
digestion I mean to be fair it takes a
lot to interpret a study but if you
dedicate enough time to learning the
basis of the basics I just mentioned the
basic Sciences
it's going to be a piece of cake but
anyway uh let's see test levels we can
run up uh
unless it's not surprises like ah my
grandpa who lived 290 had a really going
straight for 85 in injury recording
cattle yeah yeah
um you'd be surprised man just just this
channel mission is full of excuses you
know we want to blame everything on
external factors instead of looking
within and seeing what we could do about
it you know foreign
[Music]
[Music]
and this has been verified several times
um let's see
again unless you know assuming
everything stays constant even if you
end up having kids and the wife and all
that stuff there's still things you
could do to mitigate the declining teeth
from having a kid and then you know and
having kids I mean having a kid and
having a wife and all that so there's
still things you can do
um the average when you always have
characters and nope nope
um man I'm cheating because I already
watched this video debunking the whole
uh
uh only an accordion uh
what else would you why us with so many
drawing the dark side because they're
idiots well one of them because the
idiots two
well let's be fair someone of my idiots
some of them are just ignorant some of
them it's not their fault they were lied
to by doctors whatever someone's just
lazy as [ __ ] they just look for an
excuse but most people who join the Dark
Side
um I would say it's out of ignorance
they would lie to they were told oh look
this is normal oh utility was a low
because of plastics you know and like I
said only I made videos about Plastics
Plastics do have an effect but it's not
as drastic as people [ __ ] think it is
right bpas and I could show you men over
a thousand nanograms that's a little
easy and they still touch receipts and
they still have plastic everything
around them people just look for excuses
man
right you you do get a decline
yes BPA is a bad yes plastic's a bad yes
estrogen behind us about it but trust me
that's not it do not cause a significant
drop if your lifestyle is in check if
your diet is in check in fact your diet
is actually what helps you flush out
estrogen people don't even think about
this [ __ ] right I could expose you to a
ton of estrogens if your diet is on
point you're getting enough zinc enough
citrus fruits enough watch the video I
did like over 10 years ago about
estrogen people think this [ __ ] is
[ __ ] new right if you eat healthy you
can actually detoxify your body you
could flush out estrogen from your body
easy
right so it's ignorance it's ignorance
it's making people just
um pick the easy way out anyway
of course 90 years and of course it does
I'm not going to read this false this
man is the life is there you go smart
man
um people gotta understand Coalition
does not mean causation you know they
think oh look old man lower t look at
this study in this study the old man
hello to the young man therefore age
lowers T would I without even
controlling for all the confining
factors blows my mind
um
in my 40s I mean my 40s in my early days
I could work all week drink or nine on
Friday final grab multiple rounds and
then we find the next day doing that now
oh God he says test definitely lowers
um let's see
uh I can guarantee you that when you
were young you're not doing the same
things that you do now as far as the
stress and uh whatever but anyway I'm
going in circles haven't you seen old
man's strength
I'm gonna show you some strong old guys
man you know and so now if you watch
that lifestyle they are healthy because
they're not trying to die you know and
I'm trying to get a heart attack and
[ __ ]
um it's actually a good thing because
too much success don't get really yeah
that's actually true by the way it's not
the first part but the second part too
much tea can definitely ruin your life I
would be the first to tell you guys that
people were surprised in the Disco but I
was telling them that sometimes I tried
to lower my T levels so like the normal
range I mean not normal but like what's
considered normal today like around 500
or 600 and they're like why would you
want to do that I'm like dude you
clearly have not been over a thousand
underground for that so either let it on
1200 or 1300. it will ruin your life
um I could make a whole video telling
you guys The Adventures of Megan in my
you know know my [ __ ] buddies but anyway
um I'm gonna love to see his uh 60 and
pay attention
uh yep
um
I mean anyway let me see what time it is
let's see oh God damn right I gotta wrap
this video up guys
um this was fun to read I love I love
reading those comments you know
especially the ones who actually pay
attention who do their research and who
you know who don't make excuses
and who don't let shitty ass influencers
lie to them anyway guys hope this video

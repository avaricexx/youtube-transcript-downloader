hey what's up guys team 3D shout out to
my team 3D Kings out there all over the
world today is my chest and triceps day
I just got off work um got off work at
9:30 just started to H chess supposed to
be my day off today but I was like [ __ ]
it I want some iron action this is my
Walmart by the way before I do any chest
exercise I always you know just bench
the ball three to four sets just to get
the blood in the you know in the muscle
all right I decided to this week is D Lo
week for Jim went the program by the way
but as you all know I hate the Lo week
so I figured you know what let me see
how much strength I lost like I said I'm
160 lbs while I'm while I'm taking this
video I was originally 167 before I
started the cut so I lost 7 lbs and I
was scared and my bench press went down
and obviously it did as you can see I
only performed about four or five
reps it felt as if I was baning 325 I
mean my strength was nearly gone I want
to blame it on the diet I want to blame
it on the fact that uh you know I was at
work all day whatever but that that's
just excuses man I just got weaker I got
to do something about
that so as you know me by now I'm very
stubborn if I [ __ ] up on the on the set
I got to do it again again always even
if it's even if I'm going for four sets
and I you know I get to four and it's I
don't I'm not happy with with what I did
I'll do a fifth
set and here what I just did is I just
called a random guy I was like hey man I
need a spot [ __ ] that cuz I'm trying to
go to fa I'm trying to go balls
deep so I found this guy over
there I mean that's how empty the gym
was
man I'm letting him know right now that
I got to put on my bench song in case
y'all don't know me by now I got a song
for every
exercise this one is um decadence by
disturb I have a different song for
every tough
exercise so I'm trying to go for five
reps again I'm like [ __ ]
it one
two I don't go all the way down and
touch my chest cuz I'm not trying to
[ __ ] up my shoulder joints
[Music]
yeah I was done that I think six or
seven reps I was
done I lost a lot of strength since this
di thing but that's all right cuz I'm
getting all that
back once I get back on my bug guys I'm
going to be a threat I'm telling y'all
cuz I'm learning so so many things about
my
body um while on this died
[Music]
oh here by the way here uh sorry guys I
got this back cough man I'm sick Mohamed
give me that
[ __ ] um yeah by the way I just realized
I remember at one point B no Smith had
issued a challenge to see how many times
we could bench press our body weight and
I had completely forgotten about that
cuz at the time I couldn't record videos
at the gym I was going so even though I
was done with my flat bench I was like
hey you know what let me try see how
many I can get in and I think he beat me
cuz I only did like
17 I should have I should have done that
as my first you know as the first set I
would probably done 25 reps probably 30
reps I was done at that point
but call an
excuse what's that 16 reps I
think you could tell I would have done a
lot more if I was fresh I started off
like really
good anyway I'll do another one next
time when I'm
fresh I'll just wait till I start
barking again to make it
fair all right next exercise is
inkline inkline bench I don't go heavy
on
that for various reasons one for my
shoulders don't want to injure him again
and
two you don't need a lot of weight to
get your upper chest
grow I'll do four sets of this usually
five sets but since I'm dieting and I'm
tired from work I just did four
sets and I hate not having a spot up cuz
I can't go to
failure all right and I just moved on to
triceps now that's it I just did two
exercises for my chest that's not my
typical chest workout like I said I'm
dieting so everything has to change but
um so now I'm doing um one exercise for
triceps and that's it I just did a total
of three exercises today actually four
exercises cuz I did in clown flies
before I left the gym but that doesn't
really count it's just kind of like you
know and here I'm using um chains
they're 20 lb each one is 19 lb the
other one is 18 lb so it's pretty much
20 lb each so that's 40 pounds on my
neck felt like Branch Warren for a
second trying not to go too low once
again cuz of my elbows and
shoulders long as I F in my
triceps great exercise by the way guys
great exercise and the chains are a lot
more convenient for two reasons one they
make you look badass and two you don't
got to worry about you know grabbing the
dumbbell or the plate and wrapping it
around your waist and stuff like that
so that's it I just did four sets of
that and I was done four sets of bench
four sets of ink line and four sets of
dips that's
it all right guys my chest and tricep
day is over that's it short and simple
got a great pump look at this chest man
I don't know if you can see it it's
pretty pumped can y see that [ __ ] all
right guys video will be up probably
tomorrow subscribe like share the video
one of the two peace out

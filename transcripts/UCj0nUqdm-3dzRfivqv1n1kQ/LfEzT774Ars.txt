hey what's going on megan here quick
video on sleep restriction in
testosterone by the way this one should
be up
uh probably tomorrow it's testosterone
thursday but
i don't feel like editing this [ __ ]
tonight so it's probably gonna be up
tomorrow anyway long story short
check out the group the data line is the
sleep restricted group
and the straight line is obviously the
regular group right and look at the
difference of testosterone right
obviously from 2 pm a little to bm this
is when i fell asleep
right obviously testosterone production
happens at night
and look at the difference in
testosterone levels now keep in mind it
doesn't look like a lot but that's
actually about 10
right and 10 is a lot it's a huge drop
your testosterone levels drop about one
percent a year from aging
so a 10 drop is the equivalent of pretty
much 10 years of aging
right and this is after only one week of
sleep restriction
and that was five hours of sleep most
people think five hours of sleep is
normal
that's sleep restriction guys and i have
so many videos on this year after year
after year
i keep shoving it down your throat you
cannot sleep five to six hours
and then complain the next day about oh
uh you know i'm tired i have no energy i
have no motivation to train i can't
recover well you know maybe i'm doing
too much value maybe i'm over trained
i gotta hop on tlt no [ __ ] you
need to sleep more
right out of all the top five top 10
things you can do to increase your
testosterone levels and i have a video
about that you can check it out
the number one thing is sleep it's
always number one at the top of my list
all right followed by everything else
just eating enough you know enough
calories
and and fixing vitamin and mineral
deficiency
the number one thing is because think
about it guys that's when most of your
testosterone is being produced
your body only makes about seven
milligrams of testosterone a day
right three on the low side 10 on the
outside if you're lucky
right and most of that is at night and a
lot of you guys are going to bed
super late you're playing video games
all night you're playing [ __ ]
fortnight and you're watching netflix
you go to bed super late you wake up
with only five or six hours of sleep
and you wonder why in your mid-20s or
your late teens you feel like [ __ ] and
you think that oh i'm hypocritical i
have to hop on the juice
i gotta overdose on pre-workout and
coffee
sleep is so crucial again if you've been
watching my videos for a long time you
know how much i
you know how big of an emphasis i put on
sleep so you're crushing your
testosterone levels as a natty remember
you're not on the juice so you have to
have to keep your testosterone levels
manually elevated so you crashing your t
levels
which obviously is going to lower your
strength in the gym so that's obviously
going to lower the amount of fibers you
can recruit that's going to lower the
amount of weekly volume you can train
with
and of course volume is the number one
driver hypertrophy it's going to hurt
your recovery it's going to hurt your
sex drive so your girlfriend is not
going to get no dick
right and all of this primarily from
not sleeping enough that's why i keep
telling you guys stop looking for the
next hot supplement that's going to fix
all your problems when you're not even
taking care of the basics like water
sleep vitamins and minerals look at this
just
one week of poor sleep in fact here's
the study i'll post a link in the
description
but pretty much that's like a bunch of
guys small sample size but
it's been replicated so many times i'm
going to show you guys multiple studies
in the future
but long story short i took a group of
guys that had um the average amount of
sleep was about eight hours
so they had them sleep about 10 hours to
get them fully rested and then they put
them on a one week
sleep restriction protocol which was
about five hours of sleep and there goes
the results here
and testosterone dropped 10 to 15 in
just a week
now obviously your body's always going
to look for ways to adapt after a while
but trust me it's not going to be pretty
whenever your body adapts to something
to a bad habit it's
always at the expense of something else
right so try to maximize your sleep guys
stop asking me for the new hottest
[ __ ] supplement of mystery food
that's going to fix your uh you know low
energy or
low recovery issues if your sleep is not
taken care of you know even all my
clients
one of the first things i ask them is
how much water you drinking how much
sleep are you getting how much sunlight
are you getting or vitamin d
right i focus on the basics first
then we start looking at everything else
all right anyway not trying to make this
video too long because i have so many
videos on sleeping testosterone already
but you get the hint
if you're sleeping five to six hours
guys that's not enough to be honest even
seven to eight hours should be the
minimum if you're training especially if
you're training full body workouts so
you're doing nucleus overload
you're training with high volume which
you should be right
you need more sleep if the average
person needs seven or eight hours of
sleep how much sleep do you think
a [ __ ] bodybuilder or a person who
trains with high volume high frequency
constant progressive overload how much
sleep do you think that person needs
right and i could guarantee you most of
your [ __ ] don't even nap
but anyway that's the testosterone

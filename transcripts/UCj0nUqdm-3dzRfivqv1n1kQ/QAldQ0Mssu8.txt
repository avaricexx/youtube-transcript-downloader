hey guys what's going on megan here so
should you buy a turkish throne
supplement from
derek and more placement dates i've been
getting this question so
[ __ ] much ever since i released a
video like this throw on a few weeks
back
now what is turkish throne it's the
exact same thing it's like destroying
it's the exact same compound
it's just 20 percent stronger as far as
the anabolic effects go
right it's the exact same molecule that
goes like this one on the left there
goes the christian on the right
the only difference is turkistan has an
extra hydroxyl group
right here at the c11 position as you
can see right
so and that's what makes it slightly
more anabolic but it's the exact
same compound so if you watch my video
like this wrong just look at all the
benefits of uh
like this one and just transfer that
over to turkisterone and just
increase the volume by a bit right
because it's 20 stronger if you guys
want me to go in depth about turkish one
itself i can make
a whole separate video on that but for
now just watch the one i made on like
this row
so all the effects that this one has on
protein synthesis on recovery
and so sensitivity and obviously
strength you should expect
pretty much the exact same thing from
turkey serum
uh but like i keep saying just to a
slightly greater effect the only other
major difference is that
this one is actually found in reasonable
quantities in food
again in quinoa and spinach whereas
terkestron is
very very very hard to get from foods
trust me if you could get your kids from
some foods
i would be all over to kiss their own
just as i have been on
like this wrong for the last few years
not a lot of us have ajuga
growing in our [ __ ] gardens and
that's also why it's such a highly
uh counterfeited product there's a lot
of fake versions of turkish around out
there in the market
because they know you know again it's
very hard to get it from foods now
should you buy supplements in general
you guys already know how i feel about
supplements
you know i'm not a big supplement guy i
focus on the base if you watch my video
on the top 20
most important supplements you know i
keep it simple right focus on the basics
your vitamins your minerals your whey
protein
uh your creatine coffee things like that
right
i'm not a big fan of supplement
companies for reasons i mentioned in the
past
one i don't trust them two i prefer to
get all my stuff from foods because at
least i'm getting
even like this one the reason why i tell
guys don't buy supplements just get it
from foods like spinach or canola's
because
not only you're getting it from a
natural source but you're also getting
the other vitamins and minerals that
spinach are going to have and the third
reason i don't even recommend buying
action on supplements
is just in case water finally decides to
ban it because again it's been on the
monitoring program for about
a year now if they decide to ban it well
at least you're getting it from cordon
and spinach it's not gonna ban you from
eating granola and spinach
all right so you don't have to worry
about oh i'll catch them on addie called
blah blah blah
that's why i like to stick to foods if i
can but
again not everyone thinks the way i do
and i don't expect you guys to think the
way i do that's my own personal choice
and i have a lot of friends and
subscribers out there who still want to
say hey [ __ ] you again i still want to
buy uh
this one turkish one and they're asking
me who do i recommend right it's
actually [ __ ] hilarious because i
literally sit in like this one videos
guys do not buy this on supplements
and the top question i get is so megan
what check this out supplement should i
buy
it so you know people will do what they
want and i respect that so
going back to derrick i recently found
out through my subscribers that derek
sells a turkish on supplement
so i decided to do a little
investigation you guys know me i'm not
big on the fitness industry
i'm primarily a stock trader so all the
stuff i watch is mainly stock trading
videos and then i do my research on
hypertrophy because that's my life's
obsession
and my favorite hobby so i don't know a
lot about these big youtube channels
you guys know i always stay in my corner
until i'm [ __ ] with so a lot of my
subscribers keep commenting on my
comment section
uh more play small dates more placement
days more placement dates
megan look him up really cool guy now
it's not like i've never seen him before
youtube will randomly show me his videos
but
the way youtube works if you're not
subscribed to a channel they only show
you the viral
videos so every time youtube will show
me videos that will always show me natty
or not and that you're not an eddie or
not hair loss
and obviously i'm not interested in that
so i always click away click away click
away to give you an idea how clueless i
am about what's happening in the fitness
industry
i had no clue who the [ __ ] conor murphy
was until a few months ago
where i kept seeing his name every
[ __ ] where
and i literally had to go on youtube and
type who is conor murphy cause i was
like what the [ __ ] do i keep saying this
guy's name everywhere so that's how i
[ __ ]
outside of the looper by the long story
short i did some quick digging i looked
at his website i looked at
the video you guys sent me i look at the
review of my video that he made
and this is what i think right number
one he actually gave the breakdown
of what's in his product right you guys
know one of the reasons why i don't
trust supplement companies is because
they're full of [ __ ] right they always
put proprietary bland and
unknown mysterious ingredient blah blah
blah i [ __ ] hate that [ __ ] right i
want to know exactly what the [ __ ] is in
the product so
he actually gave a breakdown of exactly
what's in his product that's one
two in the most recent video he made
yesterday when he was reviewing my video
like this throne
he was actually willing to get it
shipped out to me to get it tested so
if it wasn't transparent if he was full
of [ __ ] i doubt he would make that offer
again he was gonna pay for shipping he
was going to
lose out on the opportunity cost of uh
sending out a a rare supplement
and i don't think anyone would have the
supplement was a was a scam three
in a video that i watched he wasn't over
hyping supplement right that's another
thing that i look for
you know if i'm looking at a supplement
company or somebody who's selling
supplement he wasn't over hyping it he
wasn't saying
hey this is better than chat store this
is the next big thing no he was saying
hey at best you gonna get this so you're
gonna get that so he was very objective
no snake all salesmen [ __ ] and four
and this is the part where i was like
okay well
this guy's probably legit i looked on
his website and his product is sold out
i have no idea how much he sells before
i literally went on his website he said
what she says before
but it's sold out and i'm not surprised
i told you guys it's very hard to get
your hands on to githurl
so and this is why i know that uh he's
probably not full of [ __ ] is because
if he really wanted to scam his
subscribers guys you know how easy it is
to release a supplement and just put a
bunch of fillers in that [ __ ] right if
something is sold out meaning it's
obviously a very
[ __ ] high demand he could easily put
a bunch of fillers
put it back on the website and say hey
turkish on his back in stock and make
thousands and thousands if not hundreds
of thousands of dollars
but the fact that he's actually waiting
for the entire process to take place
which again i told you that's very
[ __ ] hard to make a circus on
supplement the fact that he's actually
waiting for that
losing money in the process because
again when something is sold out i'm an
entrepreneur because i know how things
work something's sold out the demand is
we especially if it's sold out every
time it comes out the demand is insane
so if he wanted to scam his uh his
subscribers all he had to do is just put
some [ __ ] fillers
and put it back on the market which is
obviously not doing so once again i
don't know the guy may have never spoke
i'm not sponsored am i getting a cut of
anything and you guys already know me i
can be bought that's why a lot of you
guys trust my advice you guys know i
don't play that [ __ ] man uh
the stock market pays my bill so i can't
be both you guys so happy with my last
sponsor
first of all it's very hard for me to
even accept the spot so i can show you
guys the emails
of all the sponsorships i turned down
and you guys are wiping my last sponsor
the moment i smell [ __ ] i was like
get the [ __ ] out of here i don't play
that [ __ ] you guys know i cannot be
bought so
i'm making an objective analysis based
on the questions i'm getting
so once again number one he broke down
what's in his product number two he was
willing to send it out to get it tested
which i respectfully declined because
again i just took him out his word
number three he wasn't over hyping his
supplement and number four
the [ __ ] is [ __ ] sold out to the
point where people are buying it and
reselling at a higher price
yet he's still maintaining his integrity
and give you guys a you know high
quality
uh version and waiting for the whole
process so long story short
even though i don't recommend buying
supplements for those of you guys who
are still emailing me and still saying
hey megan [ __ ] you
[ __ ] your opinion we still want to buy
please recommend us to company well
there you have it i'd rather have you
buy from someone who's transparent than
these shitty
[ __ ] ass no soul having companies out
there who will literally put ice in the
bottle and sell to you for 50 bucks
all right best kid scenario works you
guys get your gains worst case scenario
you get some placebo gains and you at
least get your ass in the gym right
whatever gets you guys in the [ __ ]
gym
so that's it that's my verdict i still
decided to stick to my canon spinach and
yes by the way derek you're right i
actually looked it up it is going to has
quinoa
but i'm still not saying that [ __ ] it
just sounds so weird especially
since i'm a native french speaker we
literally pronounce things the way
they'll spell
and i just don't see how you guys could
just skip the oh
right in the middle of noah but anyway

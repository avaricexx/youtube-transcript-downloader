hey guys what's going on megan here
another episode of top tier tuesday
i decided to go all out today guys we're
going to do
top 10 races pretty much i'm going to
organize all the races right the top 10
right if you
99 chance you you fall into one of those
top 10 right if not then
too bad but i'm going to organize all
the major races all the major ethnic
groups
based on bodybuilding genetics right
what ethnic group what race
has the best potential for bodybuilding
on average
now before we even start disclaimer
disclaimer disclaimer
if you easily offended if you sensitive
do not watch this video like i always
say just dislike it
and get [ __ ] lost right it blows my
mind that we live in an era where we
can't even talk about
race and ethnic groups without people
getting sensitive and
people having superiority complexes and
all that [ __ ] okay
to me the difference between people the
difference between populations
is fascinating it's pure biology to me
right humans are just [ __ ] animals
right and just like animals depending on
where your ancestors evolved and adapted
to
that's gonna come with some differences
we all have differences and that's
[ __ ] fine
that doesn't mean one group is better
that doesn't mean one group is worse
it's so relative it all depends on where
we evolved so disclaimer number one
when i say race i'm just talking about
an easy way to categorize people right i
don't want to hear you [ __ ]
scientists in the comment section
complaining about racism shut up right
when i say asian
you know what the [ __ ] i'm referring to
when i say native american when i say
black or whatever you know what i'm
referring to it's just a way to quickly
categorize people
at the end of the day we all part of the
human race we just have minor
differences
right we have differences in muscle mass
speed strength iq
height endurance body fat distribution
you name it it's all biology
right also when i say when i talk about
a race guys that doesn't mean
every single person that falls into that
race that falls into that category is
going to have that phenotype no
it just means on average right so when
we say asians have high iq
doesn't mean every [ __ ] asian has
[ __ ] 160 iq it just means on average
right
it's the frequency thing same thing when
we say west africans have great genetics
for muscle mass that doesn't mean
every single west african is going to
come out with a [ __ ] myostatin
efficiency
i'm west african i have [ __ ] genetics
whereas my sister has great genetics
right
so there are huge variations even
between people and between races
right it just means on average so stop
taking this [ __ ] too seriously
and the last point i want to make is for
people that think genetics don't play a
role
in sports and in all these other things
get lost i can't stand your
[ __ ] people that think that
everyone can just take steroids and look
like ronnie coleman or everyone can just
train hard enough and make it to the
olympics
[ __ ] off you guys are so [ __ ] and so
ignorant of basic signs that it blows my
mind
right genetics play a huge role a huge
role
in performance right there are at least
8 000 genes that are differentially
transcribed
between high responders and low
responders even in basic bodybuilding
even in basic
going to the gym building muscle there
are over 8 000 genes
that are differentially transcribed
between the hyper responders and the low
responders
that's a lot of [ __ ] dreams guys that
means two people can go to the gym
do the exact same training same
nutrition and have vastly different
results same thing with steroids
right so get out here with that whole
just train harder you're going to make
it to the olympic [ __ ]
now again that doesn't mean you should
use genes as an excuse to not work hard
of course right that's definitely what
i'm saying
but all i'm saying is you cannot
discount the effect of genes and just
think that it's all about environment
right it's all about
a combination of genes and environment a
pygmy can train as hard as he wants
he's not going to be a center in the
[ __ ] nba right the average height of
a pygmy is less than five feet tall
good luck with that right the average
samoan
is big as [ __ ] so he's not gonna win a
[ __ ] marathon anytime soon
no matter how hard he trains all right
and last disclaimer is
i don't want to see any [ __ ]
hypocrite in my comment section you guys
want to talk about
the guys who want to blame everything on
[ __ ] systemic racism and
the moment you point out a difference
between races or actually because of
racism [ __ ] off
right you fall left liberal
[ __ ] you know what i'm talking
about
the moment i say something good about
black people that's fine moment i say
something good about any other minority
that's fine moment i mentioned one good
thing about europeans or whatever
i don't know where oh my gosh systemic
racism i can't stand you guys
you are so insecure that you can't even
give credit with credit but anyway
that's the disclaimer let's get to the
video all right so we're going to use
five main criteria to rank the different
races based on
bodybuilding genetics based on the
scientific literature so number one
acting in three genetic profile
number two my standard deficiencies the
frequency of mastering efficiencies
within that population
number three androgen receptor
expression number four
fast tourist fiber proportion and number
five skeletal structure right these are
the five
main things that contribute to a perfect
bodybuilding physique
and like i said every population is
going to have those genes it's just
different frequencies and different
population all right so let's get to it
number one european and again i'm
clumping them together right but we
obviously know there's different
uh many ethnic groups within europeans
but again european as one big group
as far as bodybuilding genetics uh
they're going [ __ ] amazing
decent acting in three profile decent
amount of milestone deficiencies
only downside is the skeletal structure
you guys know because of bergman's rule
most europeans tend to be kind of blocky
naturally right
same reason why the end of those were
more blocky than people that evolved
south for the equator or around the
equator
so any population that evolved north of
the equator where it's really really
cold
it's going to be very very hard to find
people that have you know
uh ectomorphic skeletal structures right
so it's going to be very hard to find
people with really really
uh small ways you're going to find some
but in low frequencies right people like
chris bumstead
those are very very rare but when it
comes to putting on mass
europeans can get big ass [ __ ] once
again i already made a video about that
check out the one
on strength and things like that right
it's one of the top races when it comes
to just
putting on mass and getting strong as
[ __ ] mainly because of that bone
structure
short limbs stock your body you guys
know the deal
so one of the top races for strength for
putting on a ton of muscle mass
but they tend to suffer when it comes to
proportions and having a very very slim
waste
next east asians you guys gonna hate me
for this but you guys know i gotta stay
objective
um on average east asians tend to have
bad genetics for bodybuilding
right they have great genetics for power
and strength um
but not so good for bodybuilding right
that don't have a lot of
in fact they have the worst acting m3
profile out of the major ethnic groups
they don't have a lot of milestone
efficiency they have some but not a lot
relative to the other groups
they have very very very low androgen
receptor expression
they have a good skeletal structure
though but again
they're not at the top of the list when
it comes for bodybuilding genetics
right but like i said evolution comes
with trade-offs right they have the
highest iq
right up there with ashkenazi jews but
when it comes to bodybuilding
not so much so when you do find a jack
asian right that has a great
bodybuilding physique
he's one in the [ __ ] trillion i'm
exaggerating but you get my point
next this one is going to give me so
much hate but [ __ ] it
right south asian genetics south asian
genetics are some of
the worst for bodybuilding right and i'm
going to make a video about that
explaining why again it's mainly because
most south asians when i say south asia
i'm really referring to again southern
india
and the whole region right most south
asians are born with very very low
muscle mass right
it's mainly due to repeated famines and
things like that and evolutions to that
environment again i'm gonna make a whole
video on that
but they have some of the worst genetics
again this is on average that does not
mean that every [ __ ] south asian has
bad genetics
right just on average but they have some
of the worst genetics right for
acting in three bad myostatin
efficiencies
bad angina receptor expression pretty
much
very similar to asians but slightly
worse right and they also have some of
the highest
uh cases of what we like to call skinny
fat syndrome right
very skinny very low muscle mass but
high body fat
all right and it's also because they
also have some of the highest amounts of
myostatin in the body
once again they saw an adaptation to the
stuff that ancestors had to deal with
so i always joke around my indian
friends i'm like at least you got iq
right
so once again when you find a jack
indian or jack south asian
give him a lot of respect and treasure
that [ __ ] because he's very very
very rare
right even a response to anabolic
steroids is bad
right on average all right next you have
poof
[ __ ] amazing right this is middle
east genetics right so anyone in north
africa
uh middle east arabs you name it right
that whole region
these guys have amazing amazing genetics
for bodybuilding
and i'm going to make a whole video on a
rabbis as well and north africans you
know the whole region
they have a great acting three profile
decent amount of milestone deficiencies
high energy and receptor expression high
amount of fat swiss fibers
and a great skeletal structure in fact
they're right there in the middle
they're they're right there
in the best of both worlds category and
they also have decently high iq
right and one of the main reasons for
that again i'm gonna make a video on
that uh it has a lot to do
with the mixture remember north africans
and middle eastern
a mix with almost every [ __ ] race out
there that mixed with european they
mixed with african
uh east african west african they mixed
with some asian genes i mean they have
literally the best of both worlds
lexi i'm gonna make a whole video on a
wraps don't worry yeah so they have some
of the best best genetics
uh for bodybuilding even higher than
europeans again that's mainly because of
uh the small proportion of west african
genetics that they actually have
if you watch my video on bbc genetics
and stuff like that you know what i'm
talking about you know the whole malaria
adaptation stuff
arabs have a lot of genes that help them
uh
sort of resist malaria and you guys
already know what malaria resistance
tends to come with
when it comes to bodybuilding all right
next we have
native american very hard to find a
literally like 100 native american
bodybuilder so i just pick one this guy
i think he's like a quarter native
american or something
but again pure garbage right these guys
have some of the worst if not the worst
genetics
uh for bodybuilding once again on
average does not mean everybody i have
to keep saying that because i guarantee
you're going to find an idiot in my
comment section
saying vegan said every single native
american can do bodybuilding
can't stand these but anyway yeah so
that really really bad in fact when it
comes to acting in three i think they're
at the dead bottom i have to double
check but at the dead bottom
or around the dead bottom when it comes
to acting and three
almost zero documentation to my stand
efficiencies
and they have that's the part that hurts
right there
they have some of the worst proportions
of faster slow twitch muscle fibers
good for endurance but bad for
bodybuilding and once again again this
is all an adaptation
uh to the environment they had to evolve
in remember genes that make you good at
certain things tend to make you bad at
other things evolution is not
discriminated so once again if you do
find
a native american with great
bodybuilding genetics he should be in
the [ __ ] museum
next mix races i get asked about mixed
races a lot some people that mix
white and black or whatever mixed races
have anywhere between [ __ ] amazing
and okay depending on what they're mixed
with obviously right
so those that are mixed with the people
in this category tend to have amazing
genetics those that are mixed
with the ones at the bottom tend to be
somewhere in the middle right so
uh most people who are mixed again it
depends on what they're mixed with now
if you're talking about like
uh people who are mixed european mixed
african oh they got [ __ ] amazing
genetics
galore for days right those
light-skinned [ __ ] that have
european half black
right as long as the black side is from
west africa which most people in the
diaspora are they have amazing
genetics for bodybuilding because they
literally have the best of both worlds
they have a lot of the good european
genes for strength and power
and being able to put on muscle
especially guys what makes with like
russians and
central europe and balkan region right
they have a
lot of good genetics to put on mass
right
and they also inherited a lot of the
west african genetics
which obviously helps them in that
aspect as well so if you mixed
uh european and uh west african which is
pretty much what most
light-skinned african-americans are
right that makes european
but the average african-american is
about 20 to 25 european
but those who are light-skinned those
who have more european blood are kind of
like you know again 40 to 50 percent
region
these guys great genetics depend on
their parents of course like philly for
instance
best of all for us anyway next up oh and
i also have slightly higher iq
but then again when i make the video on
iq if youtube allows me to make that
video
you guys are going to figure out why all
right next up
australian aboriginal very very hard to
find an aboriginal bodybuilder again
like i said it's not just genetic
there's also some
uh cultural and environmental reasons uh
but as far as the genetics go based on
again acting in three engineering
receptors
they're down here right like they're in
a bad category
not not in pure garbage but in a bad
category when you look at
the expression of those top five genes
and once again it's due to the region of
the world they had to adapt to
and they had to be very very
endurance-based next you have east
africans
oh my god east africans
on average have some [ __ ] bodybuilding
genetics right again on average right so
mostly
kenya ethiopia um because they have the
best genetics in the world for endurance
right they have the best genetics for
marathon running they're
very light very very very uh skinny
ectomorphic build
so again that's why they dominate
literally 90 of marathon events right
you could literally close your eyes and
grab a random east african as long as
he's part of the
collagen tribe and in less than a year
of training
that stop breaking records there's
endless endless documentation on this
these guys were born to be endurance
runners but that comes with a big
trade-off right
the body type needed to run marathons is
one of the worst body types for putting
on mass
they have a good acting three profile
though very good acting in three profile
because again sub-saharan africa
dominates when it comes to acting
three but as far as fast switch fibers
skeletal structure and all the other
stuff they don't rank that high
next you have polynesians polynesians
have great genetics for bodybuilding
uh when it comes to putting on muscle so
they get big as
[ __ ] right so they're almost in the
[ __ ] amazing category right if this
was a list
solely on getting big and putting on a
lot of muscle
they'll be near the top but because this
is a list for bodybuilding meaning you
can't just be big you got to have a
small waist
these guys go in the okay category so as
far as getting big putting on a ton of
muscle
these guys at the top of the charts i
already made a video on them check it
out
but for bodybuilding very very very hard
because again they're very endomorphic
they put on fat faster than any other
race on the planet and this has been
documented they have
well again watch the video i did on that
hey [ __ ] repeat myself but yeah they
have
the worst change when it comes to body
fat right so that blessing is kind of
like a curse right
they're put on sides fast but it's a
combination of muscle and fat
and they also have very very dense bones
very wide waist
very wide hips so that's the perfect
race for
football rugby uh but when it comes to
bodybuilding
their proportions are gonna hurt them in
fact i was gonna put them at bad
it's just that put on a ton of muscle
when they actually tried all right and
last but not least
west african descendants again if you
guys watch my video you already know
where they go
i'm about to not category the best
genetics on the planet
on the planet when it comes to building
muscle
while keeping a small waist and staying
lean
goes down to west africans right and i'm
kind of pissed you guys already know
because
i happen to be west african but i have
some of the worst in fact i have indian
genetics when it comes to bodybuilding
i have very very skinny fat jeans i put
on fat
so fast and i naturally have very very
skinny arms right so i was born with
very low muscle mass
very high uh body fat but all the
[ __ ] around me you guys already
know the story watch my video on bbc
genetics
west africa dominates when it comes to
the number one when it comes to acting
in three profile
especially nigerians people from ghana
and people from the cameroon and central
uh central africa regions are kind of
like congo cameron region
in that order nigeria ghana and then
cameroon
congo these guys have the best genetics
for bodybuilding and like i said it's
mainly because of malaria it has nothing
to do with slavery nothing to all that
[ __ ]
when the human genome project was
completed scientists finally were able
to understand why these guys
dominate all the sprinting events all
the athletic events as far as jumping
and anything like that anything that
involves fast switch muscles so
bodybuilding
sprinting jumping you name it
but it also comes with side effects
right so again high cases of low
hemoglobin high cases of sickle cell
trait
and due to the adaptation to resist
malaria and to combat a lot of tropical
diseases
they also have some of the lowest iq in
the entire world now of course
i'm gonna make a video on that to go
into details that doesn't mean they're
[ __ ] dumb people have no idea what iq
means by the way
but long story short it just means that
at birth their body focuses more
on concentrating the calories into the
immune system
and extremely fast muscular and sexual
development
at the expense of brain development so
the average west african kid
has a very powerful immune system very
very very early maturation
high testosterone levels there was
puberty extremely fast
but again that's the body trying to
combat the high death rate due to
tropical diseases
but like i mentioned earlier there's
also some differences right that doesn't
mean every west african has low iq right
for example the igbo tribe from nigeria
have some of the highest iq in the
[ __ ] world
right so they're always exceptional
right so they're always our lives right
now i'm gonna make a whole video on iq
the reason why i'm hesitating is because
it's such a sensitive topic youtube is
going to shadow band the [ __ ] out of me
once i make a video nike
because you guys already know youtube is
ran by far left liberals but the moment
you said
anything about the differences between
people that start shadow banning you
[ __ ]
anyway long story short i say guys
that's the list um
best bodybuilding genetics you have west
africans at the top followed by
mixed groups europeans
middle eastern genetics you have samoans
who are right there in the middle
and keep in mind polynesians obviously
asians as well the descendants of asians
polynesians in the middle but only
because of the
endomorphic traits bad you have
asians east africans and australians
aboriginals
and at the bottom you have south asians
and native americans but remember guys
for the millionth time
this is just on average there are always
outliers there are allies like myself
west africans who have [ __ ] muscle
building genetics
and there are outliers such as asians
and indians and
native americans who have great muscle
genetics right so
best way to find out train eat see how
much muscle you put on within the first
two years of lifting and that's a great
gauge of how great your genetics are

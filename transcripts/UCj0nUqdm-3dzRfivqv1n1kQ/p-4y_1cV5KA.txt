hey guys what's going on megan here so
take a look at group one on the left and
group two on the right
group one just went through eight weeks
of full body training with our creatine
and group two
to creatine during those eight weeks and
look at the difference
in the drop in myostatin from group one
and group two
everything else equal the group that's a
creatine had almost
double the amount of myostatin reduction
compared to group one anyway this is
another episode of my style monday where
we talk about anything related to
myostatin
quick recap for those who are new
myostatin is just a protein that your
body makes
that stops muscle growth right it's your
biggest enemy
as a bodybuilder or anyone who's just
trying to put on some muscle
for as long as you train your biggest
goal will always be
keeping this gene down regulated which
is why animals and humans who are
lacking the myostatin gene
look like [ __ ] braley without any
formal training
or any help from anabolic steroids
another example of how bad myostatin is
whenever you
immobilize your leg the reason why your
leg shrinks is because my stand goes up
whenever people have cancer or hiv and
are wasting away the reason why they
lose so much muscle is because once
again
their myostatin gene gets upregulated
and their myostatin levels go up
the reason why astronauts lose muscle
mass when they go into space
is because again once you go into space
and there's no gravity your levels of
myostatin go through the roof
causing you to lose muscle mass and if
you watch my previous video and file a
statin the reason why
mouse number two at the bottom looks
like a steroided version of mass number
one
is simply because it's lacking the
myostatin gene and
it was genetically engineered to
overproduce phylostatin which is
obviously
a protein that blocks the effects of
myostatin same comparison here look at
the lags
the quad development of miles one versus
mouse two
here's another picture of the same mice
side by side
and here's the famous monkey that was
injected with phylostat
look at the difference in just three
months that's his lag by the way
and of course if you watch the other
video on the boy from vietnam 10 year
old boy who has a milestone efficiency
and looks bigger than most natural
bodybuilders at age [ __ ]
25 so as you can clearly see as i've
been saying year after year
the myostatin pathway is far more
important and far more anabolic
than the testosterone pathway or any
other
muscle building pathway in the human
body
now a common misconception out there is
do not ease have to worry about
myostatin
absolutely as one of the biggest
transcription factors that's involved in
protein synthesis in muscle growth
is the mighty gene right acuran one and
right after a workout the correlation
between the amount of muscle you're
gonna put on and the activity of the
acura in one gene
is 0.99 so 99
of the variance between the amount of
muscle different people put on
and that includes animals as well is due
to this transcription factor here and
sure enough
myostatin blocks this transcription
factor
so you cannot escape myostatin as you
can see here once again
correlation is 0.99 that is the highest
correlation that we've seen
in all of hypertrophy research
nothing has a higher correlation in this
and obviously it is also causation
because that's
a prerequisite for dna transcription but
anyway several studies have also pointed
out how important my
statin down regulation is for maximum
muscle growth
and in fact one of the reasons why old
women well the majority of old women
have a hard time putting on muscle
is because after training they have a
very very hard time
lowering myostatin remember every time
you go to the gym every time you train
you lower my statin and the more you're
able to lower my
statin the more gains you make over time
as you can see young man huge drop in
myostatin which obviously
explains why it's so easy for young
people to put on muscle
young women decent drop old man
decent drop old women not so much and
that's why sarcopenia affects old women
a lot harsher uh than older men
even in young women the reason why young
women don't put on as much muscle as men
it's not just because of testosterone
it's also because of my statin as you
can see here women don't down regulate
myostatin
anywhere as close as men do even if they
do the exact same workout
so they'll still build muscle but it's
much harder
compared to men simply because they have
a hard time increasing phallistide and
after training
a hard time lowering myostatin and to
make it worse women actually have
double the amount of active n2b which is
the mystery and receptor
um they have double the activity of
their receptor compared to men
and as i mentioned last time the reason
why bodybuilders even on steroids look
like myostatin freaks
is simply because anabolic steroids
increase phyllostatin which obviously
keeps my styling active in a at bay
so now you guys see why the world
anti-doping agency does not allow
any unnatural means of lowering my
statin
during competition in and out of
competition
so anything that blocks the active n2b
receptor
is banned except for creatine
so i already explained to you guys that
the number one way to lower my status
obviously lift weights right it's the
number one milestone blocker out there
simply going to the gym and training
with enough value
nothing lowers my stein more than
training the only downside
is as mentioned before is that the
biggest drop in milestone peaks at about
eight hours after that my stance starts
to slowly go back to baseline
so biggest drop at eight hours starts to
go back towards baseline
which is one of the main reasons why
protein synthesis
stays maximally elevated for only about
24 hours for the average lifter
my style goes right back to [ __ ] your
[ __ ] up
now you see why nucleus overload is so
powerful you're constantly keeping
myostatin
at low levels now back to the study
again group one training with our
creatine
group two to creatine one week of 20
grams per day followed by about five
grams maintenance that's what most
studies have found to be the effective
dose and sure enough
look at the huge drop in myostatin
that we've seen in group two and as you
can expect
group two also put on more muscle and
also gain more strength
so the effects of creatine are not just
from allowing you to do more wraps or
pulling water into the muscle
or increasing igf-1 and satellite cells
which obviously creatine does all those
things
but one of the main effects of creatine
is again lowering myostatin
by a significant amount right which is
why even though you guys know i'm not
big on supplements
that's one of the few supplements that i
actually recommend because there's been
hundreds i think there's over 400
studies on creatine alone
it's time tested it's proven it's very
cheap
it's natural your body makes creatine
you can get it from foods
and it has so many effects on
hypertrophy and your performance in the
gym
now if you don't want to supplement with
creatine for whatever reason
you can always get it from foods just
remember beef has a lot of creatine
you only need about five grams per day
so eating one to two pounds of beef will
give you that easily and don't forget
your body already makes
about one or two grams of creatine a day
pork also has creatine
uh fish especially herring and salmon
has a ton of creatine so once again
that's why creatine is so cheap that's
why it's so easy to get
and that's why water can't really ban it
right even though it's so
tested and proven is because people
would just get it from foods
so it's up to you guys you could
supplement with creatine monohydrate or
you could just try to get it from food
if you're vegan now you kind of [ __ ]
right because
creatine is mainly found in animal
muscle i mean it makes sense creatine
mainly helps with atp regeneration so
you're not gonna find a lot of it in
plants in fact i think you have to eat
like uh
five to six hundred pounds of
cranberries just to get five grams of
creatine i mean just let that sink in
right pounds of cranberries
which is as far as i know the only uh
non-animal food that has creatine
that has enough greeting and you have to
eat 600 pounds of that
just to get five grams of creatine so if
you're a power lifter that's pretty much
like
your one rep max on like the deadlift
for your squad or something
you have to eat that every day from
cranberries
just to get five grams of creatine right
so again that's why vegans have lower
levels
of muscle creatine every single time
their muscles are analyzed
so if you're vegan try to get your
creatine from supplements obviously make
sure
it's from a vegan company or that it's
not extracted from
animal products but for the rest of us
again you can just get it from
supplements or foods
all right guys hope this video helps i
might make another one on

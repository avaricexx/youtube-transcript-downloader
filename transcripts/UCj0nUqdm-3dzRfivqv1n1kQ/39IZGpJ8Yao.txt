hey guys what's going on megan here
let's talk about chinese weight lifters
and how they use nuclear civil to get so
freaking jacked especially their traps
the upper back
mid back development i mean it's the
first thing that pops out at you when
you look at the physique
um and it's not just chinese
weightlifters it's pretty much 90
of weight lifters have that but um it's
more pronounced on chinese weightlifters
simply because
their training is so much different than
the other countries if you're not
familiar with the weightlifting scene
china russia pretty much you know the
top three when it comes to weightlifting
um they break the majority of the
records but the chinese weightlifters
have a unique way of training which is
very high volume very high frequency and
you can see the result
in there um in their back development
all right back to the video so
i made a video about chinese
weightlifters years ago when i was doing
research on nucleus overlord and i was
looking at pretty much every sport
that you know um got ridiculous muscle
gains from training a muscle every day
and and i mentioned chinese
weightlifters but i never went in depth
as far as showing you guys the pictures
and things like that but
take a look at their trap development
which is remarkable now of course i know
somebody's gonna be in a conversation
like they take drugs they take drugs
everybody knows they take drugs but
guess what not every athlete
or not every group of athletes who take
drugs um we take steroids have the same
back development
as chinese weightlifters yes we know
that the engineering receptors play a
role you know upper traps and blah blah
blah
but i can show you a ton of bodybuilders
ifbb bodybuilders
professional bodybuilders who have
shitty traps even though they're on
deca dynaball testosterone you name it
right so it's not just steroids right
it's obviously
the type of training that they're doing
i mean just look at this
look at this trap development look at
this this is reminiscent of dorian yates
and keep in mind these guys are small
these guys are like 170 180 pounds most
of the time
they're relatively small in fact very
small compared to most bodybuilders
let's look at the next picture look at
this guys this is literally like a baby
version of durian yet's
insane upper back and trap development
look at that you can see the butterfly
shape
and it's not just the upper traps it's
literally from top to bottom
mid traps lower traps upper traps google
chinese weight lifters you know they
have
amazing amazing upper back development
the rest of the body
looks decent but it's mainly the upper
traps and why you already know guys
all they do is train track pretty much
every day is trap day
right whether they're doing their main
lifts or they're doing accessory lifts
it directly or indirectly recluse the
traps
and in most cases to a very very high
degree
even from the front you can see the
upper traps bulging
right for someone who's this small you
know again weighing like 170 180 pounds
this is very [ __ ] impressive and
remember guys traps is
the hardest muscle to build whether
you're on steroids or you natural right
that's why it's the muscle that gets the
most respect in my opinion you know when
somebody has big traps you know they
[ __ ] lift right
it's the hardest muscle to develop
unless obviously you genetically gift it
right some people just have you know
great
great trap insertions but for the most
part you can walk into a gym
you're going to see somebody with good
biceps good triceps
good chest but very very very seldom
when you see a person with huge straps
in your average gym it's such a powerful
muscle
and it's also the reason why well one of
the reasons why i have so many injuries
you know back when i was desperate to
get traps
i did a lot of dumb [ __ ] i was doing
deadlifts and rock pools without warming
up
a lot of upright rolls even though i had
bad shoulders pretty much most of my
injuries came from me trying to chase
straps which is why nine days i could
barely do a single trap exercise for the
last few years
it just hurts too much almost every
exercise that builds your traps
i'm no longer in a position to do them
effectively because of all the injuries
i occur which is also why i tell you
guys when you're doing liquid overload
to pick safe exercises don't make the
mistakes i made when i was younger
but anyway back to these guys
look at that massive massive trap
development
you rarely see this on bodybuilding
stages unless it's really
unless you're looking at the top of the
top like ronnie coleman daryn yates
phil heath johnny jackson
but yet the vast majority of chinese
weightlifters have
their development isn't it crazy how you
literally have to look at the top one
percent
of ifbb pros to see that kind of back in
traffic development but yet you can see
it in the majority in over 50 percent of
chinese weightlifters
which tells you this it's not all drugs
it's not all genetics it's mainly
training method you know
look at this beautiful beautiful drop
development
now you might ask yourself wait what
what's so special about the training
guys if you ever watch them train or you
ever looked at videos of them training
i did a ton of research on them guys
like just look at the way they train
every freaking day is trap day
it's literally nucleus overload taken to
a whole different level
let's take a look at most of the
exercises that they do behind the neck
pull down guess what that activates your
lower traps a [ __ ] time
also a little bit of your mid traps they
do a lot of upright rolls
common sense right shoulders and traps
they do a lot of bent over laterals
reverse flies which
obviously is going to hit your mid traps
like a [ __ ]
they do a lot of wide grip upright rolls
they do a lot of high pulls
they do a lot of snatch obviously you
know it's one of the main lifts right
but i do a lot of snatches a lot of
jerks
obviously a lot of deadlifts when you're
doing the clean or you're doing a snatch
the starting position is pretty much a
deadlift
and obviously they do a lot of overhead
presses which is the ending position on
the left of the main lift
they do a lot of hang pulls snatch those
as i mentioned earlier
and also this exercise they love this
exercise which is obviously
the chest supported role right which
destroys your middle back
you try doing five five good sets of
this exercise i
guarantee you the next day your mid back
is going to be fried
it's the chest supported roll it's
pretty much like a panel roll but you
you literally parallel to the floor and
because you're lying down you're not
using a lot of momentum so your
your real delts your mid back your traps
and obviously a little bit of your lats
have to uh have to engage for you to
complete the movement
and of course they also do a lot of
dumbbell rows which obviously hits your
lats
and your mid traps especially if you
keep your elbows out
so and that's 90 of the training you
don't believe me watch some footage of
them training
read up on some of the some of the
training methods uh
some of the famous coaches is a lot
a lot of back work and keep in mind like
i said chinese weight lifters they're
trained very differently than
um russian and other european
waitlisters in that
they do a lot of frequency a lot of
volume you know
they try to switch it up sometimes they
try to periodize most of the time
but it's it's still the same concept of
just high frequency high volume
a lot of these guys train up to 10 times
a week you know a lot you know
up to 10 sessions a week which again i
don't recommend the average joe to train
that way
but it's just to show you guys the power
of the human
adaptation you train the muscle every
day for years
obviously take breaks right when i
recommend nucleus overload i'm not
telling you guys to just copy and paste
you know whatever you see these athletes
doing you're not on there
you're obviously not the same category
as them but you definitely want to take
your breaks like i said if you're not
taking the mtor reset
right which is the most important part
of nuclear overload and don't even waste
your time right you got to recover don't
say hey
i want to i want to have chinese
weightlifter traps and try to train your
traps every day for a [ __ ] year right
no
just four weeks take two weeks off
ransom repeat and i guarantee you guys
that
if you take a look at the satellite
cells right i wish that i wish somebody
could do a study on this if somebody
could just
take some muscle biopsies of chinese
weightlifters
and see the amount of nuclei in there in
a trapezius
i guarantee you is probably through the
roof but anyway guys
just quick video showing the impressive
physiques
mainly trap development of chinese
weightlifters
insane hyperplasia and hypertrophy of
course and are we surprised right i mean
it's the same thing we see with gymnasts
and they're big ass arms right it's the
same thing we see with ballerinas same
thing we see with swimmers
boxers strong man competitors you know
the same stories that i mentioned over
and over again right the power of human
adaptation
is so remarkable so moral of the story
you have a lagging body part
don't be afraid to blast that [ __ ] train
that [ __ ] every day
follow the nucleus solo principles to
make sure you obviously don't under
recover right
so stay within my recommended rep ranges
set ranges all of that stuff and as long
as your nutrition is optimal
as long as your recovery management is
optimal i guarantee
you you will see ridiculous progress

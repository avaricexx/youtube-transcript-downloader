hey guys what's going on megan here
promised you guys a till this tuesday
video
so i figured i put this one up before
it's too late so
how'd you guys vote and one guy
mentioned traps and i completely forgot
that
i actually didn't cover traps now for
those of you guys who are new to the
channel um
again the ogs already know that i still
believe that traps is the most
dominant most alpha muscle in the human
body
um sadly it's my worst body part uh
snapped my [ __ ] up in the pursuit of
traps
[ __ ] up my lower back but i'll get to
that you know in the middle of the video
but anyways the most
dominant body part you could have you
walk into any gym everyone has big arms
big chest
big back big legs those are easy to find
but
very rarely you'll find somebody with
monster straps you know unless he's on
he's on a juice of course
even most of the guys on steroids have
small traps so
and i'm talking about upper traps mainly
it's such a powerful muscle to me
everything else is overrated you know
everyone's trying to be super lean
trying to have a six-pack you know ben
had done that that's overrated in my
opinion um you want a six-pack starve
yourself that's easy
but monster straps geez those are so
hard to get by
um and you guys know you know i was so
obsessed with trap [ __ ] since i was a
kid that i've done
so much research on them so i know the
best exercises the best way to
activate them um but for the sake of
this video we're going to focus on
mainly the upper and mid traps mainly
the upper tractors that you know to me
the upper traps are [ __ ] king right
to get that broadly look
right so there goes the criteria and
keep in mind guys the function the main
function of the
upper traps it's really three functions
the main one is obviously keeping your
arms attached to your body i've
made a video about that years ago right
so the heavier
the weight in your hand the heavier the
weight of your arms the more the upper
traps are going to be engaged
so any movement where you're holding or
lifting heavy [ __ ] [ __ ]
you're going to activate the [ __ ] out of
your upper traps the second thing is
obviously scapular retraction yes your
upper traps help
retracting your scapula as well as the
middle traps and obviously the third
primary movement is actually and that's
the one that everyone ignores
it's actually scapular rotation right
rotating your scapula kind of like when
you're doing side laterals right
obviously the higher you go
um the more rotation you know same thing
when you're doing overhead presses if
you lock out at the top
your upper traps are actually going to
engage um with the movement
right so we're going to pick exercises
based on those three functions all right
so let's get started
um so let's start with dumbbell incline
trucks right when you incline
now obviously that's going to activate a
lot more mid traps also your upper traps
a little bit of your lower traps
but if i could only pick one exercise
for the rest of my life
uh that wouldn't be it right so i want
to put that one out okay right decent
get a good contraction
um next year power shrugs power
structure i'm gonna put
at [ __ ] amazing and remember guys you
gotta get that stretch right i've made
so many videos about that
years ago you got to get that stretch
traps are very very powerful muscle
so the stronger the downward pull the
more they're going to contract to keep
your arms attached
so power shrugs [ __ ] amazing mainly
because of the stretch right
the contraction not really using a lot
of momentum you know it's too fast for
your um
your muscle fibers to produce enough
force you know you're going to recruit
them by you know
by shrugging up but they're not going to
produce enough force because the
velocity is just too high you know
force velocity relationship but at the
bottom that stretch is going to activate
the [ __ ] out of your traps
um next deadlift same thing it's the
reason why deadlifts are great
um trap builders because of the stretch
crazy imagery activation
i'm gonna put that lifts uh [ __ ]
amazing
actually i'm gonna put him out okay for
actually yeah [ __ ] amazing simply
because
not only you activating your upper traps
but at the top of the movement uh you're
also activating your mid traps to
obviously keep your back from rounding
forward
so [ __ ] amazing for for traps next
you have the face pulls face facebook
i'm gonna put the facebooks at
i'm gonna put the facebook that [ __ ]
okay right good for your mid traps
good for your upper traps a little bit
of lower trap activation
um but again you know uh you're not
really getting that stretch right so i'm
in fact i'm going to put this shot i'm
going to put this step back
i'm sorry right you know if i could only
pick one exercise for the rest of my
life it wouldn't be facebooks
which i keep in mind guys i love
facebook if you have my hp program you
know facebooks are in there grateful
traps great for seidels great for real
delts um great exercise but
as far as traps go remember traps need
heavy weight and a stretch
overload right you're just not getting
that with face pulls you know good if
you're trying to get a good contraction
though so on pump day this would be
amazing
all right next we have high pulls hypos
i'm going to put them at
[ __ ] uh [ __ ] amazing because
you're getting almost
all of the functions of the trapezius
you have elevation you have scapular
rotation
um you obviously have mid-back you
obviously have scapular retraction right
really good exercise and you have a
stretch at the bottom right so high
pulls great exercise
for traps t-ball rolls believe it or not
t-ball rolls is an amazing exercise
for traps for one as long as you you
know you're going heavy you're gonna
have a crazy stretch at the bottom
um you're gonna retract your scapular
and obviously if the weight is heavy
enough
you're definitely definitely gonna have
that stabilizing
uh requirement so again [ __ ] amazing
believe it or not you know everyone
thinks t-ball rose is just mainly a lat
movement you're activating your traps
your rhomboids everything
next front raises believe it or not
fundraisers activate your traps
especially if you go overhead
but unfortunately you're not gonna get a
crazy stretch at the bottom and there's
a limit on how heavy you can actually go
right so i'm gonna put these out okay um
behind the neck press believe it or not
i'm going to put this one out okay
really good for the traps now you know
you might think well this is the
pressing movement what is that doing
here
your traps are very very active when
you're doing behind the neck brush
especially if you got healthy shoulders
right
one you're obviously doing scapular
rotation you're also retracting your
scapula because remember you'd be
putting the ball
way behind your head so very very good
exercise for the upper traps
uh but it's unfortunately not in [ __ ]
amazing oh i'm about to not carry simply
because the stretch is not as powerful
right the fact there's no stretch at all
next you have the overhead shrug man i
[ __ ] hate this dumb ass exercise but
i put this one at bat right
you actually got a good contraction in
your tribes you're mainly doing um
scapular rotation all the way at the top
are you gonna get a sick contraction but
number one you can't go stupid heavy
number two there's
zero stretch right zero stretch involved
and lastly the range of motion is
trash right so so i'm definitely gonna
put this on a bad right you're not gonna
meet someone and say oh man you trapped
some massive what did you do oh i did
overhead shrugs [ __ ] that right nobody
says that
next bent over roll again i'm going to
put bent over roll
as [ __ ] amazing surprisingly
as long as you go heavy right as long as
you go heavy one you're gonna have the
stretch at the bottom you're gonna have
the scapular retraction
obviously your arms are holding heavy
ass weights so the traps are gonna be
very very very engaged
and of course you're activating your
upper lower and mid traps
next neck curls for the ogs the lg
subscribers know what i'm talking about
i used to be obsessed with training my
neck years ago again i was looking for
the the secret to big traps guys
and sure enough you know training your
neck is going to activate your upper
traps
the only downside is it's obviously
awkward you gotta find you know not
every gym have to
have the equipment for it at one point i
even bought the the neck harness and
eventually i stopped because i started
getting neck pains i was doing it wrong
i
i was getting imbalances because i was
only focusing on one side so i finally
dropped it you know it's one exercise
that you know you don't want to just do
one side you want to do the front the
back
and in some cases the side but i started
getting that pain so eventually i'll
stop but yeah this is me trying it out
at the gym using i think that was the
side
how a [ __ ] machine i was it was it
was definitely a neck machine but me and
marco were [ __ ] around i decided to
uh train my neck with that but anyway so
i'm gonna put that one in obviously bad
right if i could only do one exercise
for the rest of my life it would not be
um this when it comes for again for trap
development
next cable roll to the chest this one is
obviously doing to his belly button but
cable roll to the chest is okay right
good exercise for traps it's going to
activate your lower traps your mid traps
and a little bit of your upper traps
wide grip upright row now this exercise
is [ __ ] amazing guys for one man keep
in mind this is you know
i recommend people go even wider than
this right because the closer you go the
more bites you saw involved
one you're obviously getting your side
delts now i know this is not a video for
side deaths but it's a nice bonus right
you're hitting your side
delts if you bend slightly forward
you're gonna hit a little bit of your
posterior deltoids
but this will fry your upper trap a lot
of scapular rotation
a little bit of elevation some
retraction at the top of the movement
and as you go heavier and heavier you're
going to get a good stretch at the
bottom next you have the y
rays ah i'm gonna put this one as bad
it's a good exercise for traps guys but
keep in mind this is
mainly gonna hit your lower traps mainly
obviously it's gonna hit a little bit of
your upper and mid but
it's mainly lower trap exercise now even
though the lower traps is actually the
biggest part of your traps
um i'm not too concerned right you know
this video is mainly for upper trap
development if i could only pick one
exercise
it would not be this one so again i'm
not saying these are bad exercises
i'm just saying relative to the top ones
yeah they're down here
next you have uh again coronavirus
version right this is the home version
the inverted row
right so if you're doing bodyweight
training or if you're training at the
park
this one's a nice it's pretty much the
cable to chest version but you're
obviously doing you know body weight so
i'm going to put this one out okay
very good for mid traps uh very good for
lower traps
and a little bit for upper traps now of
course you know what's going to be an
okay and up up here
there's no stretch side laterals again
i'm going to put side is that okay
people forget the side laterals
activates the [ __ ] out of your trap
especially if you go heavy
and you bend your arms a little bit
really really good exercise for
not just side dogs but also upper traps
the only downside is again you know
there's no stretch at the bottom
military press again as long as you lock
out at the top you're gonna get
crazy crazy upper trapezius contraction
but i'm gonna put this one out okay for
the reasons mentioned before
haney shrug again i'm gonna put this one
out okay right
for the reason i mentioned before you're
gonna get a good contraction you're
gonna get
good scapular retraction but you can go
really heavy on this
right so the stretch at the bottom is
gonna be very poor
next headstand push-up i'm gonna put
this on a bat right
pretty much the opposite of the military
press just using your body weight
um if you have no other option this is a
good exercise for your upper trap also a
little bit of your mid and lower
but again for the sake of this video
it's going to be down here right if i
could only pick one exercise
i would not pick this one reverse flies
i'm gonna put this one out okay mainly
because you get a really
really good activation of all three
regions so your upper traps are engaged
your middle traps are engaged
um and obviously your lower traps and
you also get the bonus of training your
side desk and your real dots people
think this is only a real dead exercise
it actually activates your side that's a
lot
because of the overlap and if you go
heavy you're really going to feel this
in your traps and rhomboids
dumbbell sharks again i'm going to put
this out okay unless you go really heavy
if
you go really heavy and you turn this
into a power shark then i'm gonna put
that [ __ ] amazing right
but just the standard dumbbell shrugs
i'm gonna put them out okay
again because you're not really getting
that deep stretch at the bottom monkey
shorts i'm gonna put these out okay
because they're kind of like a bootleg
great value version of wide grip upright
row you're going to feel a good
contraction
it's going to activate your upper traps
um a little bit of your mid traps but
almost no lower trap activation right
this is mainly the scapular
um elevation and scapula rotation
function of your traps and of course
there's no stretch at the bottom so it
can go higher
heavy barbell shrugs again i'm gonna put
these
at [ __ ] amazing mainly because of the
stretch at the bottom and keep in mind
this is heavy bubble shots not light
sharks right
so i want to put these here because the
heavier you go the deeper the stretch
and the higher uh the emg activity
white now wide grip barbell shrugs those
are going to be in [ __ ] amazing but
obviously higher
than the regular version right as i
mentioned i'm not only getting the
stretch at the bottom but
notice the arm angle right so you're
activating the traps a lot more
if you're doing snatch grip uh you know
quote-unquote wide grip short as opposed
to
the standard version because there's an
additional scapular rotation element
here
remember the upper trap fibers are not
vertical they're slightly horizontal so
this is going to activate them a lot
more than the standard version but both
will give you an insane
stretch so [ __ ] amazing farmer walks
i'm about to nut guys this exercise
now obviously soreness is not a great
predictor of hypertrophy
but i'm telling you guys this exercise
will [ __ ]
the [ __ ] out of your traps such a great
trap builder the downside is
it's not very practical right uh unless
if your gym is crowded it's very hard to
do this and yours and it only works if
you're going heavy if you're going heavy
um this exercise is amazing your mid
traps are going to get engaged so
obviously stop your back from rounding
your upper dress are going to get
engaged because again your arms are
heavy as [ __ ] it has to keep your arms
attached to your body
on top of that you walking so all your
stabilizer muscles are activating
i mean this thing activates your traps
more than any
[ __ ] exercise out there except for
one
trust me guys farmer walks heavy farmer
walks are
insane next the crock row again i'm
going to put it a [ __ ] amazing mainly
because you're getting scapular
retraction and you're getting a crazy
crazy stretch at the bottom
power cleans i'm going to put by claims
they're [ __ ] amazing and this is
clean
any clean variation really good for
driving there's a reason why all these
olympic lifters have jack traps right
that's all they do clean clean cleans
pools
pools right claims will have you so as
[ __ ] the first time you do them the
reason why they're not higher is because
the race the injury is too high you know
for bodybuilding purposes
you don't want to do power cleaning for
bodybuilding right you're going to snap
your [ __ ] up eventually
but this thing does almost every
function in your traps scapular
retraction scapular rotation
obviously some elevation i mean power
clean especially if you're doing a
cleaning but if you're doing the
cleaning price then you're combining
this and that
and it's just [ __ ] god more but again
it's not practical for bodybuilding
purposes right
um the risk of injury is way too high
next behind the back shrug i'm gonna put
this one out okay man behind the back
shrug you can't go stupid [ __ ] heavy
on those
and also you you know your range of
motion is limited if you have a big butt
next the yates roll again i'm going to
put the yates through at uh i'm going to
put the gates for
[ __ ] amazing as long as you're going
heavy just be careful so that you don't
[ __ ] up your bicep like again like
during yay stead you're getting crazy
scapular retraction here and again if
you go heavy you're gonna get a good
stretch at the bottom it's gonna be an
amazing stretch but it's gonna be decent
and i kept the best for last the og's
knew this was coming this was me here
back in 2012
the rack pulled above the knee this is
the
king the king of all trap exercises i
remember i was so in love with this
exercise back in 2012 i used to call
these the megan pools because
nobody was doing them and i just wonder
like why is somebody doing this [ __ ] out
of every
trap exercise i've tried
nothing and i mean nothing gave me
results faster
and got my traps more sword than the
rock pool and eventually for those of
you who were wondering
that side snapped my [ __ ] up and that's
the big red flag that's the big
disclaimer here when you're doing rock
pools you gotta make sure you warm up
properly
and you don't get too too [ __ ]
excited because that's what that's the
mistake i made
i was making so much progress on these
and my trust were finally growing keep
in mind my traps are my worst body part
ever so
i was finally getting results on these
that i was getting ahead of myself i was
just piling on the weight i was skipping
warm-ups i was just rushing you know how
when you're doing rack push-ups you have
to warm up one play to play three
i was just going in and just slapping
play skipping warm-ups and sure enough
[ __ ] up my back right um on top of the
deadlift stuff so
and this is how you know this is one of
the this is the best exercise of all
time because after i snap my back up
i try to use the other exercises to
bring up my traps wrong
did not work did not work as well as the
raccoon
the stretch you are getting at the
bottom of this is
insane your traps have to work to
stabilize your scapula your traps have
to work to keep your arms attached to
your body
and every [ __ ] motor unit is
recruited when you're doing this
movement
every month remember guys the traps are
very
and i mean very [ __ ] strong which is
why this exercise is so [ __ ] powerful
because
none of these movements here will allow
you to use the weight you're going to be
using the rack pulls none
right but like i said the danger is up
there you got to be careful guys you can
snap your [ __ ] up
if you don't want more properly and if
you ego lift which is the mistake i made
and now i got to spend the rest of my
life with that mistake right even to
this day guys
i mean this is back in 2012 we're now 20
21 years later my back is still [ __ ]
up right i'm always doing rehab
move work i can no longer do heavy
shrugs i can no longer do bent over
rolls once i'm using the machine i mean
anything i use in my lower back is
compromised
um so yeah guys it's the best exercise
of all time for traps
but it comes with a heavy cost if i
repeat if
you do dumb [ __ ] right if i was warming
up properly
i would have had no issue and also keep
in mind i already had a deadlift injury
going into this injury here so
it's really so technically the deadlift
stack she led to my rightful injury
all right guys that's it um sadly there
was no pure garbage exercise for traps
if i had to pick one
you know you know what for the stick of
this video let's pick one it'll be this
one get the [ __ ] out of here right
nobody's [ __ ] doing this for traps
right um but with coronavirus you know
it might actually have a a place you
know for those who don't have thing but
even if your dream is closed just buy
some [ __ ] dumbbells and do any of
these movements right
um but yeah so that's it guys uh make
sure your program has these exercises
involved right anything from [ __ ]
amazing or i'm about to nut

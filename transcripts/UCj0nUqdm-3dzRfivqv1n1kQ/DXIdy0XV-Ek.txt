hey guys what's going on megan here look
at this guy i mean this guy
is [ __ ] ripped guys and look at his
arms his
abs any guys today is wednesday so i had
to bring back
what the [ __ ] wednesday where we just
talk about genetic freak so anybody who
has really unimpressive physique
now usually i only talk about mass
monsters or people who are really out
there but i had to make a video on this
guy subscribers sent me this uh
send me this a while back he was like
megan i saw your nucleus of the little
videos and you gotta check this guy out
and boy was i impressed long story short
this is from a video
on a youtube channel called going
filipino or something like that i'm
gonna put the links in the description
but
anyway this guy was found in the
philippines somewhere working as an
abaca harvester and look at his body
guys
first let's bring out the vegeta scouter
get some info on him
so the little info i was able to get as
far as this right so again his name is
alan
from the video uh he's from the
philippines
so south asia the height is about five
foot five
from what i was able to gather from the
evades and also the fact that you know
the average height in the philippines
for man is usually around five four
five five and he looked close to that
height wait i would say about 125 to 135
again that's in line with the average
weight
uh for miles there and again if you look
at his frame he looks like he's in that
ballpark
and he makes a living processing a
backup which you guys know it's a very
very very
uh physically demanding job and to give
you an idea how physically demanding the
job is check it out right this is the
clip from the video
it's pretty much rolling all day right
every day is cable roll day right
doing this for hours at a time biceps
are engaged
back is engaged i mean can you imagine
having to do this for a living you know
hours at a time
day after day this is very demanding
it's pretty much nucleus alone every day
right cable row every day
you know very similar to what
professional rovers have to do you know
uh your biceps are engaged every i
remember these guys have to feed their
families right so there's no
there's no oh today's not back day so
i'm not gonna do you know
harvest ibaka no that's not how it works
right these guys are doing this every
day
uh you know until they get hired by the
next person rinse and repeat you know
and then they finally take a break and
wait for the trees to grow again or for
somebody else to hire them right so
very very physically demanding job and
look at the physique on this guy
insane insane development i keep in mind
he's no bodybuilder right but
again that's what makes this so
impressive is the fact that he looks so
ripped
and he doesn't even have access to the
stuff that we have right no gym
keep in mind this is a very poor part of
the philippines so no gem
uh obviously you know steroids but to be
fair these guys do eat healthy you know
there's one thing about pole places you
know they
actually eat healthy because you know
less processed food but still look at
his physique guys can you imagine if he
was actually on a regimen
you know on i mean look at his abs here
right look at this
insane can you imagine if you actually
access the stuff that we have access to
you know
and if it was progressively overloading
and things like that i mean this guy
would be
a great natural bodybuilder and if he
hopped on the juice god forbid
i mean just look at his calves even his
calves man
but don't get me wrong guys this is
definitely a combination of
uh great genetics right even i can't
attribute this to just nuclear silver
load it has to be a combination of lego
silver and great genetics because
i'm pretty sure not all the uh ibaka
harvesters look like that you know i did
some research i couldn't find any other
more
uh examples but are we surprised you
guys remember my old nucleus of a little
videos
remember the jacked african divers the
ones that had to
dive to the bottom of the river or
whatever and carry these heavy ass
buckets of sand
right you guys remember that we did one
hour video i made look how jack these
guys are same thing right
manual labor every single day nucleus
overload style
you know look at these heavy ass buckets
pretty much had to dive to the bottom of
the river
filled the buckets with sand swim back
up and they had to resist the current
and they developed these crazy crazy
jack physiques
right very similar to our boy island
here you guys remember that video if you
if you haven't watched it already i
really recommend you check it out
i really go in depth about nucleus
overload right manual labor you know
manual labor day in and day out and
obviously they take breaks because most
of these jobs are seasonal
right so that's like the african version
of allen or you could say allen is the
asian version of these guys
i also went over the the guys over there
in indonesia right the ones that have to
carry these heavy ass
uh buckets to suffer look at look how
huge this trap saw
keep in mind this is a skinny guy all
right but look at these straps again
that's my having to carry that [ __ ]
every single day even the old guy
the old guy in that documentary where i
got the pictures from look how jacked he
is look at his traps guys look at his
biceps
stop [ __ ] around with nicolas
overload man these guys are not
doing this to get jacked they're just
doing this to feed their families you
know
and getting jacked is just a side effect
and that's without access to all the
stuff we have you know can you imagine
they were actually trying
and the reason why their growth stops is
simply because of progressive overload
right after a while you know they don't
just keep adding more and more
uh volume or more and more loaded just
show up to work do whatever it takes and
stop
but yeah alan's physique is amazing i
wish we could find this guy man
and find out there are more people like
him he actually reminds me of tony john
by the way you guys should check out his
movies if you haven't very similar
physique but he actually
looks more jacked a little bit more now
this guy probably also does some kind of
body weight stuff on the
on the side i mean i won't be surprised
if that's the case
um i mean one can argue that the guy
that was working right alongside him
looks like [ __ ]
but um he's a lot older and you know we
don't know if they're
doing the same volume right this guy's
probably working a lot more hours
doing a lot more volume and this guy's
probably more like hey my
my days are working like a madman are
probably over so who knows by the way i
just wanted to go over this uh video
real quick since it was a video idea
send by sub
uh remember to check out the original
video it's ongoing filipinos channel
and comment below guys i mean let me
know what you guys think also feel free
to send me
more examples like this so i could cover
them in the next uh
what the [ __ ] wednesday videos doesn't
have to be nuclear solar related could
just be anyone with a genetic freak who
has a very very impressive physique but
long story short
less than a day is you want to get
jacked fly over to the philippines and

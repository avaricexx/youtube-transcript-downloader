showing you guys the evolution of things
throwing some sweet potatoes here a
little bit of Honey to the stir fry got
some pasta cooking rice on the
way time lower
down man my kitchen dirty as
[ __ ] quick look at what's going on here
a little stir fry action beef mushrooms
onions bell pepper all kinds of
seasoning you make me better
all right guys next step making my this
a little see I don't want to throw away
the Bones and [ __ ] cuz a lot of meat
attached to it so I figured I'll make
another sauce with it which is you
guessed it my pea sauce so this is
coming up so far I got the sweet
potatoes and stir fry with the parmesan
I got the
pasta [ __ ] out [ __ ] out I got the the
vegetable combination to make my doodle
come out nice now got some spinach and
the rice is still
cooking CH three I got that's it here's
my food for the next couple of
days need some
rice
pasta that's the stir
FR with the parmesan and the sweet
potatoes that's the
veggies and and some
spinach now is it necessary to do all
that of course it is especially if
you're on the
budget like I said I my call V my
Crea anyway like I
said
um oh by the way that was the hardest
part of this [ __ ] that's the problem
with cooking mad [ __ ] dishes anyway
as I was
saying you're on the budget
it helps buy your [ __ ] and cook it
otherwise spend too much money on subway
McDonald's Wendy's and all that [ __ ] and
it adds up like the last two weeks of my
life was terrible broke had to keep
borrowing money left and right
especially because of the whole baby
thing but I learned my lesson that's
what I like about putting yourself in
the situation because you learn a lot of
effective life lessons I used to mass
prepare meals and I stopped and then
look what happened so I went back back
to square one back to cooking back to
managing my my money properly and in
fact I'm going to open a different
account where I could just not a savings
account it's going to be a me account
where I just put money for like um that
I'm not even going to touch cuz a saving
account you could actually touch that
[ __ ] I want to open put on the camera
could just put money but I'm not going
to touch this way it it it tightens my
budget even more you know I can't be
[ __ ] around no
more baby's expensive all right

hey what's going on megan here all right
so why do the levels of my statin drop
maximally at the eight hour mark right
why is it that the biggest reduction you
get in my stand from training
peaks at about the eight hour mark as
you can see in this study by the way i
referenced the study several times
the white columns refer to the groups
with their resistance training you could
ignore the black balls that's for just
cardio
as you can see obviously from training
my stand drops the most we already know
that
but the question is why is it only at
the eight hour mark right how come it
doesn't stay
down regulated for a longer time which
will obviously allow us to put on
maximum muscle in as short a time period
as possible
anyway this is another episode of my
statin monday where we talk about
everything related to myostatin which
is obviously the most important gene and
the most important molecule and pathway
when
when it comes to building as much muscle
as possible
now if you're already familiar with my
statin and my recap on it you could just
skip to the next chapter
else is going to be very repetitive for
those of you guys who are new
here's a recap of what microstatin does
all right so long story short
my statin is a gene it's a protein that
your body makes and its job is pretty
much the limit how much muscle you could
put on
right if it wasn't for myostatin it will
all walk around like the [ __ ] hulk
right
so that's four main things it stops
protein synthesis
it increases protein breakdown it lowers
satellite cell activation
and it makes you insulin resistant which
obviously leads to
less muscle more fat so pretty much it
makes your skinny fat
phylostatin on the other hand it's
another protein that your body makes
and it does the opposite of myostatin
right it stops myostatin
from activating its effects to its
receptor it also stops active in a
so this is the most anabolic molecule in
the human body
phylostatic even more anabolic than
testosterone in fact testosterone's
effects are mainly mediated through
phallus that
here are some examples of what happens
when your myostatin levels are too high
for example the reason why your legs
shrank when you put them in a cast so
you
immobilize for a long time is because
myostatin levels go up
the reason why hiv and cancer patients
lose a ton of muscle so fast
is also because the myostatin levels go
up
and the reason why astronauts lose a ton
of muscle mass in space is because once
again when you go into space in a low
gravity environment
my stand also goes up right so my stand
is the bad guy
if your goal is to maximize muscle
growth here's an example of a rat at the
bottom here this is the control right
this is a normal ride
and this is the rat that was genetically
engineered to over produce phyllostatin
and to also lack the myostatin gene
so as you can see that's the biggest rat
we've seen in in research
four times the amount of muscle as a
regular rat
right so and once again normal levels of
testosterone
normal levels of antigens it is so
massive
it's not even funny and here's what the
rat looks like
when it's actually alive straight
broadly
dwarfing the other rat and this is lean
muscle as well extremely low levels of
body fat
this is the monkey that was injected
with phallus style as you can see here
this is before the injection this is
only a few weeks after the injection
about three months after the injection
absurd amounts of muscle growth and this
is the 10 year old kid who was lucky
enough to be born with a myostatin
deficiency once again he has normal
levels of testosterone
completely natty but look at his
physique at 10 years old right
his parents were freaked out and brought
him to the doctor and yeah
he's healthy perfectly healthy normal
levels of androgens
didn't go through puberty yet yeah he
has more muscle than the average
grown ass man once again this is what
happens when
you're lacking myosin or you over
producing phylostat and again the reason
why professional bodybuilders look so
[ __ ] huge is because
one of the main effects of testosterone
is to interfere with the master and
pathway
mainly by up regulating phylostatin or
increasing the activity of the rgf1
pathway
several studies also back this up as you
can see here one of the most important
transcription factors in fact
the most important transcription factor
for muscle growth is accurate one
you can see here the correlation is
0.999 which is
in short the most important
transcription factor for hypertrophy
and sure enough my satin blocks this
gene
so you want to put on gains you have to
down regulate my stat and you have to
lower my stat
another study shows the same thing the
correlation with the amount of gains you
put on after training
and your ability to lower my statin is
negative point 82 which is massive
my stand is also the reason why old
women put on a lot less muscle than
young men
or old man after training mainly because
they have a hard time lowering my statin
even when they're trained
as you can see here old man have a big
drop in my stand after training
young men have the biggest drop in my
style and after training which is why
again young man put on muscle so fast
young women decent drop but old women
struggle
to lower myostatin which is why they
struggle to put on muscle mass
and several other studies confirm this
as you can see here
one of the main reasons why women cannot
get as big as men
even if you inject them with
testosterone is because their myostatin
activity is way too high
myostatin is also responsible for
insulin resistance so if you have a dead
body you skinny fat you have that tire
around your belly
well chances are you have very high
levels of myostatin
next myostatin is also the reason why
those who train with full body workout
so with high frequency tend to put on
muscles so fast
because the dropping myostatin after
training
only lasts for less than a day right the
drive peaks at the eight hour mark and
then slowly after that my stand goes
back to baseline right it goes right
back to [ __ ] up your gains
so that's why those who train more
frequently just full body workouts
nucleus overload
tend to put on muscles so fast right
they're constantly keeping myostatin
down regulated
smile stand is also the reason why
people will supplement with creatine
tend to put on more muscle
it's not just the other effects of
creatine it's mainly that creatine
also is a very very powerful myostatin
blocker as you can see here
this is the drop in my starting from the
group that trained with our creatine
and this is the drop in myostatin from
the group that trained with creatine
huge drop and lastly
that's the reason why the world
anti-doping agency
ban every single agent
that drastically blocks myostatin or
increases file style
but if you want to lower my style and
you're going to have to do it naturally
and i have a ton of videos on that just
watch the playlist
all right so back to the video so keep
in mind guys training is the number one
way to reduce mouth stand naturally as
you can see here
every single bar here is every single
study or i should say relevant study
on my standard reduction from training
as you can see the biggest drops usually
about 40 to 50 percent
drop right which is a massive massive
drop in my stand
from training right so stop falling for
these supplement scams out there right
you want to lower my stand
you have to train nothing is going to
drop it as much again naturally
right it's funny because people think
that we go to the gym to build muscle
not really you go to the gym to lower my
side and when my statin is lowered
your body can finally go beast more and
start building muscle right so it's
pretty much you go to the gym
to say myostatin let my muscles grow
that's why people who are lacking the
myostatin gene don't even have to go to
the gym right they just put on muscle
just by [ __ ] living
right they just exist in a soul whereas
the rest of us
actually have to train to temporarily
uh quote unquote turn off the gene
anyway back to the study so to answer
the question why is it that the
milestone drop
only peaks at the eight hour mark right
again this is on average of course
there are variations based on your
genetics but the main reason if you look
at all the studies the same thing
right about 20 by the 24 hour mark your
my style levels are back to baseline
right so they're back to [ __ ] you up
which is once again why you have to
train so frequently if you're natural
now the reason why it peaks at the eight
hour mark is because guys if it doesn't
you would just put on muscle
relentlessly right you guys have seen
all the videos of the
other pictures of the mouse standing
fishing kids and master and efficient
animals and stuff like that if you
constantly have myostatin low
you're gonna literally keep on growing
right as long as you're eating enough
calories to fuel protein synthesis right
now of course we would love that right
you know you know i'm pretty sure you
guys listening like wait a minute that's
exactly what we want
but your body doesn't want that remember
guys my satin has evolved for a reason
almost every animal out there has my
stats so it's been conserved
evolutionary for a very
very long time millions of years even
fish have myostatin
right and the reason is simple the body
does not want to get too big guys
remember
building muscle maximum amount of muscle
is not what the body wants
right the body wants to especially
humans we've evolved to be endurance
an endurance species right and that
requires low amounts of muscle mass
right enough muscle to move
but not so much that it requires you to
eat too many calories
or it slows you down during endurance
hunting i know it's shocking for some of
you guys but yeah the body does not want
to build muscle that's why it's so hard
to build muscle for the rest of us right
and if you're genetically gifted that's
obviously doesn't apply to you but
for most of us again that's why my style
evolve is to keep you small as shitty as
it sounds because remember when there
was famines back then and there were
famines all the time
the first people that died were the ones
that had too much muscle not enough fat
right because think about if you have
too much muscle it takes a lot of
calories a lot of energy to keep you
alive
to keep you moving the smaller you are
and the more body fat you carry the
longer you can survive famines
people forget how much energy is
required on a daily basis
to maintain excessive muscle mass why do
you think bodybuilders even on steroids
why do you think they have to eat so
much
right ask anybody any ibb pros on
a crap ton of drugs ask them what do you
hate the most about bodybuilding they'll
tell you eating
right they don't eat every three hours
because they want to it's because they
have to it takes a lot of calories to
maintain
that ridiculous amount of muscle mass so
that's why
as a species we evolved to have myosite
it's to keep us from getting too big
right and also remember stat makes you
store fat right makes you less insulin
sensitive now you might think today we
might think storing fat is a bad thing
right but back in the day starting fat
was crucial to survive famines
right so that's why the body does not
like myostatin
uh at such a low level it's up to us to
constantly bring it back down right
drops from training and goes back to
baseline within 24 hours
and if you notice that's exactly the
reason why every single study on protein
synthesis right muscle growth
shows that protein synthesis peaks at
about the 24 hour mark right sometimes
less than 24 hours
right you can't escape this guys muscle
building takes less than 24 hours
my fibular protein synthesis peaks
within the first 24 hours after lifting
after that it starts to go back towards
baseline
so it's still a little bit elevated but
not significantly elevated right
and study after study after study after
study has shown this
right you cannot find a single human
study uh
without using steroids of course or
whatever natural where protein sentences
peaked longer than 24 hours not a single
one
and you guys know me i've looked through
thousands of studies i love this [ __ ]
now if you're on steroids that's a
different story right because if you're
on steroids after training you're going
to get a huge spike in protein genesis
it's gonna start to go back down slowly
but because your testosterone levels are
constantly elevated
it's gonna take you a long time uh for
your protein sentences to go back to you
know pretty much baseline right so that
so that's why people on
juice can train once a day right i mean
once a week they could do chess on
monday and come back
next monday if you're natural you don't
have that privilege right you get that
big spike
boom back to baseline and if you've been
training for a long time
it's even worse right that [ __ ] goes
back towards baseline
quick as [ __ ] so believe it or not the
longer you've been training the more
frequently you have to train
right obviously you have to manage
recovery you know so you don't [ __ ]
overdo it
but you get the point without making
this video too long that's the reason
why
my style and the biggest drop in my
style and picks it around the eight hour
mark
simply because if my stance stayed low
for
much longer than that your protein
sentences your my fibular protein
sentences would just stay elevated to
the root right and you would literally
just keep growing you guys have seen
what happened
uh on last monday's video with the
monkey that was injected with father
stein or whatever
i mean with the virus that increased
father saturn he grew like a [ __ ]
weed why because his mouth stand was
constantly being downregulated by father
satan
right now of course like i said we would
love to have this but that's just not
how the body works right if you're
natural
especially if you have average genetics
you have to bring that [ __ ] back down
right at least every 24 hours if not
every 48 hours
remember guys if you don't drop my stats
significantly after training
you're not building muscle that's a fact
there's no way around it
and the research is clear on that but

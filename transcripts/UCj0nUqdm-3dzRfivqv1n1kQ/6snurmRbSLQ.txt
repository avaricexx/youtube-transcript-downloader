hey guys what's going on megan here top
10 nucleus of the lord misconceptions i
looked at
all the questions i've been getting
slammed with for the last few days
and i decided to answer them all in this
one video now again a lot of the stuff
is things that i've answered a million
times in the past
over the last nine years that i've been
talking about this
but i know it can be cumbersome to dig
through all the free videos and
find the information you're looking for
so i'm going to condense the top 10
questions the top 10 misconceptions
in this one video let's get straight to
it this video is going to be in
a quiz format so if you've already
watched my videos a million times and
you feel like your understanding of the
topic is uh
is up there then feel free to answer
before i actually
give out the the correct answer all
right misconception number one nucleus
overload is to build muscle in 30 days
what do you guys think correct
wrong wrong nucleus overload is to
increase
sensitivity to future muscle growth
right it is to increase your myogenic
potential
right so increase the amount of
satellite cells and nuclei
in your muscle which will facilitate
faster muscle growth in the future now
if you put on muscle during that 30-day
period and great that's a bonus
i've said this a million times if you
put on muscle during
those four weeks that is a bonus in fact
some have
um especially if they manage recovery
well right you guys know that's that
that's that disclaimer you gotta manage
recovery well
if you don't manage recovery well then
you're obviously not gonna put on muscle
but guess what you're still gonna get
the satellite cell activation which is
the whole point of nucleus overload is
to increase the amount of nuclei and
obviously satellite cells
in your muscles and that will in turn
make your muscles more sensitive to
growth once you return to normal
training
next question nucleus overload is to
replace normal training
correct or wrong what do you guys think
the og subs know the answer
wrong nucleus overload is to supplement
your normal training that's why it's
only 30 days guys
and that's why it's also only one or two
muscles max
i picked those parameters years ago for
a reason guys
how are you going to replace your the
whole training if you're only doing it
on one or two muscles just common sense
so no nucleus will it is not to replace
normal training because i see a lot of
times
well why not just try normally it's not
to replace your normal workout
and that's also why i say at the end of
every nucleus of a little guide
at the end return to your normal
training at the end of the 30 days
return to your normal training so if
you're doing levels a little on your
biceps
at the end of the 30 days after you do
the mtor reset which is not optional by
the way that's mandatory
you return to normal training it's a
simple
30-day experiment it will cost you
nothing but 30 days of your [ __ ] life
it's free and as i always say either
works or it doesn't
if it works great you can implement it
to your other muscles you can
repeat it with the same muscle if it
doesn't work then medium [ __ ] lie
move on right so i repeat nucleus reload
is not to replace normal
training that's why i have hsb training
and guess what
seventy percent of it is basic heavy
lifting guys that's what hp stands for
heavy
stretch pump heavies and obviously heavy
ass weights
stretches and weight is stretched which
obviously you need heavy weights to do
and the last letter is p
which is going to be your pump day and
hsp training can be used
across multiple splits i have push-pull
hsp variations i have bro split
variations and i have
my favorite ones full body workout
variations and even those
are only two to three times a week for
starters advanced users
can bump it up to six times a week if
they can handle the additional stress
if they manage recovery well that's what
i say in every single
comment in every single video but for
ninety percent of you guys
start with the basic version just pick
one or two muscles
next nucleus or load is very very
lightweight what do you guys think
wrong nucleus overload is 15 to 20 reps
close to failure guess what that's 40 to
60 percent of your one rep max
most of the times around 50 for most
people that is not
lightweight you guys i don't know where
that started when i say lighter weights
simply means you're not going you're not
doing [ __ ] three to five reps
if you guys know me my favorite rep
range is six to eight wraps i love it
because
it's right there in the middle and i can
drop set it to get the benefits of heavy
lifting and get a sig pump at the same
time
but nuclear silver load is 15 to 20 reps
and that's not light weights i don't
know who told you that
light weight is something like 50 60 70
raps that's very light or 100 reps
that's not my recommendations for it's
15 to 20 reps
why did i pick that right branch because
the goal of a set
is to recruit your high threshold motor
units if you want more details about
that
i'm gonna post the link watch my video
on what's the best reference to build
muscle
there is no best prep branch to build
muscle i've been saying that for years
as long as you're going close to failure
with a heavy enough weight
you will recruit your high threshold
motor units so
if you're trying to do a hundred reps in
one set guess what you're wasting those
first few reps
because it's not until you get closer to
failure that's your high threshold motor
units are going to kick in
so why waste all that time when you
could just do 15 to 20 reps the longer
you train the longer you stay in the gym
the deeper you tap into your recovery
reserves and we don't want that right
and yes obviously progressive overload
is a part of nucleus of the law
when i say 15 to 20 reps of failure we
guess what after a point that's gonna
get easy
what do you do when it gets easy right
you can increase the reps which is fine
you can go up to 25
30 reps whatever but you can't keep
increasing the reps forever because then
you're going to be doing 100 [ __ ]
reps right
so what do you do you increase the
weight or you find a way to make it
harder
next nucleus overload is to overload the
muscle
correct or wrong wrong
nucleus overload is not to overload the
muscle
the overload that i use in nucleus
overload refers to the amount of nuclei
you're trying to increase the amount of
nuclei too much nuclei too many nuclei
people forget that the word overload has
two meanings
you can look that up in a dictionary
overlord has two meanings you could it
could refer to heavyweight
or it could refer to an access to
something right so when you say oh man
that's too much information that's
information overload
what do you think that means it means
too much information when you say
electrical overload
right or when you just see too much
stupidity and you say oh man that's
stupidity overload
right so that's what i'm referring to
when i say a nucleus overload and i
explained that in the original video
years ago you're trying to increase the
amount of nuclei so
what is a cool way to say too many
nuclei remember when i was trying to
name nucleus overload
me and my friends were going through
different examples we were brainstorming
you know we
we tried excess nuclei nucleus
multiplication
maximum nuclei nucleus overcharged
nucleus accumulation i was
brainstorming through different ideas
and it all sounded corny the best one
was
nuclear solar and i picked nucleus
instead of nuclei because nucleus just
sounds so much [ __ ] cooler
right so i had to explain this so many
times but here it is again
nucleus overload does not come from the
very study that i even showed you guys
remember i was the one who showed you
this study
back in 2013 and i explained overload
exercise
does not mean nucleus overload it's just
a term that scientists use when they're
referring to heavy weight they use
they either use resistance training or
they say overload exercise and here i
give some examples if you look it up in
pubmed
they use that phrase for different
things it just means heavy weight
it has nothing to do with nucleus
overload people think oh look there's
mario nuclei in the title
and then there's the word overload here
so that just means nuclear overload
wrong wrong wrong i've explained that a
million times and i have to do it again
so the next time someone tells you oh
you have to overload the muscle
no no no in fact the weights on nucleus
overload are not super heavy it's only
50
of your one right max okay next nucleus
overload is every body part
wrong nucleus overload is one to two
muscles max
in fact i always recommend people to
just start with one muscle why do i tell
them that
because number one most people suck at
managing recovery i'm telling you guys
i've been training people for how many
years
99 of people suck at managing recovery
they don't sleep enough they don't drink
enough water that thing they do but they
don't
uh most people don't get enough protein
or enough calories it's one of the two
if you get enough calories you don't
need as much protein if you get a lot of
protein on your
calories but stand on topic here
they don't get enough vitamins and
minerals in fact most people are
deficient in vitamins and minerals
right so most people's recovery
management is horrible that's why i
always say just pick one muscle
two if you can't help it right
so no it's not every body part is just
one or two
now once you advance once you've been
doing this for a long time once your
recovery management is a1
then you can start to take some risks
applied to more than just one or two
muscles
in fact next nucleus of the load is over
training
wrong in fact nucleus overload is all
about recovery
i don't shut up about that it's all
about recovery first you understand guys
this over
training and it's under recovery all
right over
training is relative if you've been
training for years and you go to the gym
and you do three sets
close to failure the next day you won't
even feel a thing right
another person who's never lifted a
weight in their lives will do
two sets of ten and be sore and full of
muscle damage the next day
over training is relative right what
most people call over training is really
under recovery
they go to the gym they [ __ ] lift
weights they're in there for like three
hours whatever
which is fine you know as long as you
can't recover from that kind of training
right
but then they come home and then they
sleep five hours a day
they [ __ ] you know eat like 100 grams
of protein even though they weigh like
200 pounds
eat vitamin and mineral deficient foods
barely drink enough water and i said oh
i'm over trained nope [ __ ] you
under recovered
right so you got to make that
distinction guys and remember
my parameters for nuclear silver load my
program
are to speed up recovery that's why i
say one or two muscles why
recovery exercise i say pick safe
exercises like push-ups or
tricep push-downs or whatever if you
over train from doing push-ups then
something is [ __ ] wrong with you you
might as well just quit working out okay
five sets of push-ups
should not burn you out same thing with
tricep push-downs right
i say pick safe exercises the rep range
is also to help with recovery that's why
i don't recommend that you do 100 reps
per set
or that you do super heavy weights on
nucleus overload
the sets that's why i recommend only
five sets instead of 10 or 20 or
30 sets in a day the duration
that's why i say no more than five
minutes
why do you think i have all these
recommendations it's for recovery it is
to maximize recovery because if you're
not recovered you're wasting your time
training and the most important part of
nucleus overload is what
the mtor reset phase when you take one
to two weeks at least one or two weeks
of zero training guess what why do you
think that is
recovery next nucleus of the lord is
templars yesterday
everyone already knows the answer to
that one wrong nucleus will it is not 10
yesterday
is five sets or if you're using time on
attention
no more than five minutes either way the
whole thing should not take you more
than five minutes
now what happens if you do more that's
fine you feel like you can recover from
more then that's your choice you know
different people like to change the
parameters around but that's based on
their own profile that's based on a
goals that's based on
overlapping muscles whatever but my
recommendations are always
5 sets or no more than five minutes
next nucleus overload has no studies to
back it up what do you guys think
correct
wrong wrong blood flow restriction
training
is the best proxy for nucleus overload
why the frequency is similar the reps
they have there are so many studies on
blood flow restriction guys they've
tried every reference you could think
about from as low as 15 to as high as 70
plus
right so just look at the ones where
they did 15 to 20 or 15 or 30 reps
sets as low as two to as high as five
sets a day so there are a ton of studies
on bfr would have tried different set
schemes
two sets three sets four sets five sets
the rest spirit is also very similar to
nuclear solar because it's very short
it's only about 30 seconds like the
solar is about 20 to 30 seconds
and the results the highest satellite
cell response
ever in response to training on humans
has been shown on blood flow restriction
training
so it is literally the best proxy for
nucleus overload
now you might ask well isn't it
different because they're using bfr
bands
the bfr bands are not some magical
device
all they do is make a lightweight feel
heavier or very lightweight so if you're
using
very lightweight like thirty percent of
your one-way max
that's when the bfr bands come in handy
but as long as you're lifting in my
recommended rep range and in my
recommended
loading range which is around 50 to 60
percent you want my max or 15 to 20
close to failure
the bfr bands add no additional benefit
the research is clear on that i
recommend the bands anyway because
why not the pump is insane so it is the
best
proxy for nucleus overload next
nucleus overload is just high frequency
training
no [ __ ] [ __ ] that's probably one
of the dumbest things i've heard
that's like saying 5x5 is just weight
training
german volume training is just weight
training crossfit is just weight
training of course it is
it's a branch of high frequency training
but guess what high frequency training
is an umbrella there's many different
types of high frequency training
some focus on strength some focus on
hypertrophy some focus on cardio
olympic lifters believe it or not i
actually doing high frequency training
because almost all of the lifts use the
traps
mid back and the legs strong man i made
a lot of videos about that almost every
strong man exercise you could think
about requires the use of your traps
cyclists and sprinters and speed skaters
all that stuff right even when they're
not training
they're not doing bike work they're
doing leg work so there's a ton
of different high frequency training
variations but they each have different
rap scheme different set scheme
different
rest periods duration exercise blah blah
blah blah
nucleus overload is my variation
of high frequency training and it has
one goal
which is to increase the amount of
satellite cells and nuclei
in your muscles that's why it's called
nucleus overload
right concurrent hypertrophy is a bonus
meaning if you put on muscle while doing
it
right great in fact you should if you
manage recovery well but the real goal
is to increase the amount of satellite
cells and nuclei in your muscle
so that you grow faster in the future
last question nucleus overload is the
future of muscle growth
correct or wrong correct yes i
said it high frequency and satellite
cell nuclei focus
is the future guys and i know this for a
fact
just look what happened over the years
right so nine years ago they called me a
madman using thanos's voice
my avengers peeps are going to catch
that and that's
that's when i was a small channel you
know 88 subscribers i'm never going to
forget that number
because i actually thought i made it i
was like oh my god 88 subscribers that's
amazing
and i thought i was crazy right even
eventually my channel grew to a thousand
and five thousand and ten thousand that
was the bro split era
where if you said anything outside of
training once a week you were called a
madman
now don't get me wrong some people were
recommending frequency and full body but
it was very very
very very few and all i had back then
was just anecdotes
stories stories about my friends who
were doing it stories about the athletes
the things that i saw growing up
eventually started doing all the
satellite selling nuclear research in
2013
and look what happened after that right
you got c.k fletcher who came out in
2013
and talked about how he used to do homes
every day so that caught a lot of
people's attention
and rich piana came out around that same
time around 2013 as well
and he introduced something called his
feeder workouts which are very very
similar to nucleosolo
so that also caught people's attention
then i found all the blood flow
restriction studies in 2015.
keep in mind blood flow restriction has
been out since 1960s
it was called katsu but it wasn't
popular in the u.s because
it was against the agenda you know back
then it was just oh once a week and just
looked super heavy so
it was very very very undiscovered gem
and i've been recommending it ever since
because it is so effective
and little by little more and more
people are talking about bf4 more and
more people are doing it
then eventually signs started to confirm
the high frequency
the benefits of high frequency and look
what happens since then look what
happened in the last nine years guys for
those of you guys who've been around
that long
the guys who used to preach bro splits
left and right slowly started to
increase their frequency they went from
oh you just got to do it once a week hit
your chest on monday and don't hit it
until next monday right i mean the
experts used to say that
now they slowly went up to twice a week
then some of them slowly went up to
three times a week eventually
they're slowly moving on to full body
workouts
and now i'm finding i'm getting tons and
tons of messages finding out that
there's a possibility that bronze era
bodybuilders did something similar to
nuclear solo
again i still got to research that stuff
people send me those links all the
[ __ ] time but guys remember i gotta
research something before i actually
make a video on it
so far there's very very limited
information on this but if that's indeed
true then that's even more
evidence behind solo so i'm hoping that
this is true but anyway
guys mark my words in the next few years
satellite cells and nuclei are going to
be the topic
of everything that's at personal free
related conclusion
if you're going to do nucleus of law
remember recovery is everything i'm
always in the comment section repeating
that
manage your sleep water intake protein
of calories
vitamins and minerals including sunlight
for vitamin d
and obviously your testosterone levels
all right guys i'm out and let me know
what you guys
think about that assassin's creed
valhalla trailer that [ __ ] got me hyped

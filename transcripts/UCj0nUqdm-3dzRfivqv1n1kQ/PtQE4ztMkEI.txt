hey guys what's going on megan here this
video is gonna be the ultimate guide to
nucleus overload it's gonna be a lot
shorter than the one-hour version and
it's gonna answer every single question
you have
about nucleus of the law from the
creative nucleus of the lord himself
so bodybuilder of the day is today is
the natty edition it's obviously going
to be megan
uh high five seven to five eight on a
good day weighed 142 when i first
started back here when i thought i was
so
all the way to 235 which was my heaviest
that's when i stopped pretty much
bodybuilding instead of focusing on just
being a dad and other stuff but as you
can see i kept some of my games and
using the same format as last time
everything starts with genetics
my story on nucleus overload started off
with the fact that i had
shitty genetics going up as you can see
here look at that head on megan look at
the face right but you guys wonder where
the puffy tricks came from
right so i was destined to not put on
size you know right
this picture here that everyone knows
right i posted almost every time
right look at my arms here after two
years of lifting
right this is when i was in college and
believe it or not i actually thought i
had muscles i actually thought i was one
of the biggest guys around
my friends would tell you that like you
couldn't tell me nothing i thought i was
actually sold
after two years of everything when
really my two nights were asked you know
and look at my face here this is me next
to my sister
and i'm blurring the face of a lot of
people here because now people are
having issues with their job you know
looking for them online and you know my
channel is obviously not politically
correct so
but anyway start off with shitty
genetics combined with an obsession for
muscle
mass i grew up worshiping people that
had huge muscles i just love that guys
again
if you know me you know dragon ball z
vegeta is my favorite character
you know bradley you know uh i grew up
loving wrestling the rod goldberg and
obviously when i was a kid my idol was
oh no schwarzenegger when it came to
bodybuilding right because i watched
conan
terminator so long story short i had
these genetics but i wanted to look like
this right
so remember people that have the worst
genetics work the hardest why
because we got to do so much more just
to be like everybody else you know what
i mean whereas i have friends that would
just
literally look at a jump rope and just
[ __ ] lose weight or they'll just
you know look at ways and just get sore
so i had to
look outside of the conventional methods
so here are the observations i made
growing up observation number one
people that train the muscle every day
had that muscle over developed
period right and i don't care if they
were natty i don't care if they want to
juice in fact
i have over a hundred different examples
of people on nucleus overload
people who didn't increase overload
obviously accidentally um and
only seven of them were bodybuilders who
were on steroids so i don't want to hear
oh i started for people on steroids
what about the other 90 right
so you have my uncle you have uh david
and his lats
you have madden his drivers you have the
girls who literally
do squat every single day every day is a
booty day and they have
shoes glutes you have uh the story of
milo
right whether it's a legend or it's true
you know he wasn't carrying that book
once a week
right you have mechanics and four arms
you're gonna tell me every mechanic is
on steroids or every mechanic
genetically has strong forearms
right you have marco and the straps you
know you guys know story marco people
that play rugby
or football and have to train traps
almost every day
um you have the muhitar story you have
to suffer uh
carrying [ __ ] all the way in
asia who have some of the worst genetics
in the world
yeah you have bodybuilders natty
bodybuilders and the front delts that
are over developed
you have people that play muay thai and
are always kicking those [ __ ] uh
bamboo trees and [ __ ] to strengthen
their shins right you don't see their
legs shrinking
even though the shin is a bone you have
the wheelbarrow [ __ ] you got
ballerina in the cavs you got the
fishermen in cameroon you have myself
you have the people who live in
mountainous regions they have huge cavs
people that used to hike a lot
i know i know at least one of you guys
watching this video have a friend that
used to hike a lot and has
massive caps right so and that's just
the natty stories right so i don't want
to hear oh you know
uh steroids and at the top since we know
that it has nothing to do with just uh
uh having you know being on juice or not
you got bodybuilders right
is it a coincidence that the one
bodybuilder the only bodybuilder that i
know of who did shrugs
every single day when he was young has
the biggest straps in bodybuilding
history
is it a coincidence that speed skaters
and sprinters and track cyclists have
these massive
well-developed quads is it a coincidence
that olympic weightlifters have these
huge straps
boxers have to have that thick neck from
doing neck almost every day
people in prison will do push-ups every
day have big chests
swimmers in the last gymnast and their
[ __ ] homes i mean i could go on and
on and on and on guys i have so many
stories on this and i made so many
videos in there but people are still
questioning it so that was absolute
version number one but as a kid i did
not know why
you obviously have frank mcgrath who
used to do forums every day and
again just like johnny jackson right
once he got on the juice once he became
a bodybuilder
his forearms would not stop growing
right but anyway so that was mission
number one and i didn't really know why
at the time
you know i was i was young i was wishing
number two they were doing a lot of time
on attention right so it was high reps
high volume when i say high raps
a lot of them were just again carrying
stuff or you know like the wheelbarrow
guys were just doing
pretty much farmer walks all day and got
these huge traps
without even you know asking for it
right so there's a lot of weekly volume
a lot of time on the tension right and
no one
really knew why right until i got older
and i realized
there's a lot more to the story episode
number three long breaks you know they
will take breaks
over 90 of these stories for some reason
they would take accidental breaks
because remember that's not something
that we're actually trying to do to
build muscle
they were just doing that some of them
were doing it to build muscle but some
of them are just doing it because it's
about their job or their sport
and obviously in every sport you know
you take breaks whether you want it or
not
there's an off season or even if it's a
job most jobs in
poor countries are seasonal so that
would take long breaks then when they
would come back
not only do i gain the the muscle back
which is obviously muscle memory we all
know about muscle memory
but you know they would constantly get
bigger and bigger you know up to a point
of course
because they were not really you know
training you know for bodybuilding
absolution number four extreme
sensitivity to growth after the break
you know which is what i just explained
right whenever
when i came back or when i joined
bodybuilding the muscle
came on so fast not just the muscle
memory i was obviously that always takes
place
but they grew past that sticking point
so i created a program right
and you can see guys this video is on
youtube guys my very first video on
nucleus overlord
was back when i i think it was back in
2011 right and i have it right here
last went to 2011 and i made a video
called push-ups every morning whatever i
was awkward as [ __ ]
it was one of my very first videos on
the channel this is years ago guys
i went back and tagged those videos so
you guys could find them and i explained
you know every morning just two push-ups
you know because again this is this is
based on
pure anecdotes back then i didn't know a
single thing about
the the science behind it in fact no one
[ __ ] knew
i just knew it worked you know my
friends that were doing it um
you know my uh my african friends we
should do the same body parts every
single day
i made a ton of videos about those guys
go check them out so i created a program
and i said guys
i don't know the science behind it but
the science will eventually catch up my
old subscribers know exactly what i'm
talking about
right because they were there from day
one and i told him pick a muscle you
know
uh and the reason why i always say one
muscle is for recovery purposes right so
that
you know you don't burn yourself out um
because most people struggle with
recovery
um but obviously if your recovery
management is great you could do more
than one more so
the weight i say like to moderate
because again i was replicating what i
saw
growing up you know not not all of these
guys were using heavy weight you know
ballerinas
are not [ __ ] you know they have big
gas from just using their body weight
you know
people that do push-ups every day you
know like myself you know when i did the
whole push up every day experiment
uh as a kid to try to you know be my
friend in the back so
light to moderate weight and i was going
to prevent injuries help your recovery
and it was going to save time
right and so you exercise pick something
simple right cable machine dumbbell body
weight again once again to prevent
injury and
and to recover faster reps keep it high
close to failure but not completely you
know
to failure sets around five sets five
minutes you know pretty much delicious
here respiratory very short
the goal was to just maximize that pump
get in get out
done and i should do that every morning
for my chest and that was my
recommendation
um and of course you know the goal was
do it for 30 days take a break
one or two weeks off and all these
numbers that i was throwing out
it was literally just me both signs
saying based off
all the observations that i saw growing
up right all the and i would even ask my
friends we should you know train the
bodybuilders every day you know just
taking notes over and over again some of
them are still here
you know and eventually the goal was
guys when you return to training
you should see the same effect that all
those guys you know experience
and of course there's a lot of criticism
you know like oh that's over training or
you know high reps don't build muscle
because remember you understand guys
back then and anyone who's honest and
who was in the fitness
community back then will admit it back
then if you said anything about training
more than once a week
you were laughing they're like oh that's
over training you don't know what you're
talking about
you shouldn't show the muscle morning
once a week you gotta do it on monday
and wait till the next monday to hit it
again
blah blah blah so the so-called fitness
experts
were like oh these guys are talking
about this is [ __ ] and they were
saying high reps don't build muscle
you gotta go heavy you know you gotta
have weight on the ball you know you
have to be [ __ ] heavy you gotta
[ __ ] you know have p.o every [ __ ]
day
all right all the bs that's been
debunked now but at the time you know
ever
everyone believed it because experts in
court said so you know
they're like oh some people on steroids
you know literally
ninety percent of the stories about
natty's right they're like oh it's only
swelling
uh you know it's not gonna you know last
a bunch of [ __ ] right but the one
that pissed me off the most was they
kept saying oh there's no science behind
it there's no science ban and i hate
when people look at overwhelming
evidence
and still deny it because there's no
study on it
right so i was like [ __ ] it they would
just speak for themselves
i did it and i literally picked not only
i had almost everyone do it on my
channel
but i pegged the people with the worst
genetics and you guys know me you know
audrey subscribe my
lazy line again i gotta cover
everybody's faces of the whole linkedin
[ __ ]
um but uh lazy line look at the
transformation all these pictures are
taken from videos right i made sure
i took them from videos so that you can
go and watch the videos yourself in case
you think oh maybe it's photoshop maybe
it's the wrong person
the videos on my channel guys and the og
stars will point you right through them
all right so you got lazy line huge
transformation all these are just in a
matter of months you got mohammed
you have um my brother who was skinny as
hell at the bottom here
right he just wanted to uh bring up his
shoulder and his triceps he wanted to
copy me on that pause
right so every single person who tried
nucleus of a little guy results right
look how flat my traps were
on the left side and they finally came
up and in fact i was doing rag pools
every day
when i discovered that rack pulls with a
[ __ ] for traps and obviously until i
snap my [ __ ] up and that's why i keep
telling people do not do nucleus
overload on the heavy movements you know
eventually you're going to injure
yourself especially if you're stubborn
like me but that's a whole different
video
but yeah everybody put my arms my my
you know my back thickness my lat width
everything that i couldn't grow after
years of lifting
blew up when i started doing nucleus
overload and union full body workout
combining all that stuff you know hsp
bone density you know
nine yards but i had to find that
science record people were still saying
well you know despite all the proof all
the evidence you know
people were still saying oh oh there's
no science behind it so i started
digging
keep in mind at the time my major uh was
uh business you know i have three
i was doing three associates right in
business administration general studies
and liberal arts
and then eventually i graduated and went
on to do you know
two bachelors one in finance money
management so
bodybuilding and building muscle was not
my major that was just my passion that's
not even telling you guys if somebody's
passionate about something i would come
home and i would literally skip my
homework on business or whatever and i
would just study high percentage all
night
you know i was i would look at animals i
would look at you know i like thinking
outside the box right
i didn't want to you know learn
hypertrophy by reading [ __ ] articles
that's [ __ ] because everyone is
always trying to sell you some [ __ ]
supplement or some [ __ ] program
so i went outside of the box i looked at
cancer research oncology i looked at
animals
i looked at myostatin and eventually i
started literally studying biology
anatomy kinesiology chemistry physics
biochemistry i even went to neuroscience
at one point and matt was helping me
with that you know too because
that was his major i studied military
history to see how they were training
their warriors
endocrinology biochemistry my supervisor
at the time
couldn't stand me because every morning
she was a biology professor and every
single morning i would go to and just
pick a brand and ask her a million
questions about her birthday you know
and eventually it paid off right finding
the science
behind it and that was one of the
happiest days of my life i made a video
about that that's when i found a study
right my nuclei acquired
by overload exercise procedures you know
not lost in your training
long story short that took a group of
rats and again it's funny because i
found a study
and i made a video about it the very
same day i was so freaking excited you
could still find that video on youtube
there goes the date december 2013 and
you can see
you know i literally drew everything on
the board i give you guys the link to
the study i said go check it out
and people are acting like this study is
new like they just found out some [ __ ]
i've been i've been talking about the
study for years i've mentioned almost
every video
but anyway so they find out that th that
if you take a rat and then you pretty
much uh
break one of the slack to make the other
leg work harder eventually
not only the muscle grows but the nuclei
within the muscle
accumulation again i'm not going to go
into too many details because i'm pretty
much repeating myself
in another video but here were the key
highlights new my nuclei are added
before any major increase in size
right don't overload and when i say
overload guys they're talking about
weight here they're not talking about
overload as in when i say nucleus
overload i'm going to explain that later
it's two completely different things
here they're just talking about weight
you know scientists like to use the term
overload
when they're referring to just excessive
weight so anyway so pretty much they
were explaining the concept
of muscle memory and how muscle memory
work and i was so excited because that
literally explained
every single thing i just kept both
asking about this whole time so i made a
video about that i was super super
excited
and then from then on the resources took
off because from once you find a good
study
it's very very easy to just snowball
into finding more and more and more
and eventually i was able to back up
every single claim
i made about nucleus overload right more
growth and ease more nuclear i found
this study
that was actually in 2008 long story
short they pretty much saying for you to
get bigger
right once you make it past your your
new gains you need to add nuclei right
and i've been beating a dead horse over
that over and over again
force for muscle continue to get big it
needs
more nuclei and how do you get those
nuclei
boom several studies showed nuclei gains
without heavy weights or excessive
muscle damage because remember
people kept saying oh you're not lifting
heavy enough when you
tell people to do high rap studies after
studies after studies
have shown that whether the person is
trained untrained male
female doesn't matter as long as you're
training all meaning you know close to
failure
or blood flow restriction training which
is pretty much pump training
um you are going to get a crazy increase
in satellite cells in fact occlusion
training which is you know pretty much
pump training on cracks
i've been recommending it for so many
[ __ ] years actually gives you more
satellite sales than regular heavy
training
with minimum damage in fact occlusion
training katsu right
is the only method of training that
actually has the least muscle damage
out of all other training techniques so
if i want to say oh you got to go super
heavy you got to kill yourself in the
gym in order to get
[ __ ] [ __ ] right i've been telling
you guys that for so [ __ ] long and
there are so many studies to back this
up look them up guys
and that explains why i was able to
build my chest and my old subscribers
remember that you know like my chest was
overpowering my physique when i started
by the building and everyone thought oh
maybe you should get genetics
wrong they forget that i was doing
push-ups every single
day and i explained what i wasn't
pushing every single day but anyway mtor
reset
right study back that up showing that
again look antibiotic signaling becomes
less sensitive to resistance exercise
but is restored after a short duty
training period so i was the
first one and you can find those videos
online to combine
every single thing about you know
training every day
and um the satellite cell response
with the mtor study to pretty much back
up a nucleus overload and it
literally felt like i was a time
traveler because a lot of these friends
have but this study came out in 2013
right and that's what i'm telling you
guys just by observation you will notice
things that's
the science will catch on later and
later later some studies we found were
actually released a lot earlier
but a lot more came afterwards so
finally i had to name the program so
first
i should just call it training every day
right and obviously that's not a name
right because there's a lot of different
training methods when you're training a
muscle every day um next i was like all
right because everyone kept calling over
training because they're like oh you're
just over training your muscle you're
not going to recover
so i was using the name over training
with quotes you know it was sarcasm it
was like all right well you know that
was my way of saying well if you guys
think
you know that that's over training then
over training works then you know and
you can watch those videos you know
where i literally kept making those
remarks
but then people were confusing it with
under recovering you know i can do
new uh lifters where seeing that and
thinking holy [ __ ] you know like am i
supposed to train and i recover and i
was like no [ __ ]
like that's that's sarcasm and finally
cg fletcher came out in uh 2013
obviously you know
he's been around for a lot longer but no
one knew about no one knew he was in
2013. i think he made a video came out
saying the strongest
strongest man you've never heard of or
something and he went viral right and
he had his philosophy and that he also
called it overtraining it was completely
different in nucleus overload for him it
was more like just training
balls to the wall like two hour workouts
destroying the muscle
so people started thinking that the over
training that i was referring to was the
same thing as his method same thing with
his protege mike rasheed you know people
thought oh you know
uh uh the over training that these guys
are promoting is the same thing as
nicola
when it wasn't and then of course that
same year uh rispiana
uh blew up you know again no one knew
who he was before then and he started
talking about a strategy called fetal
workouts
which is very very similar to nucleus
overload the only difference is he was
using extremely lightweight
way lighter than what i recommend for
nucleus overload and for him
you know it was just about putting blood
into the muscle right so it was very
similar but it wasn't
you know really nuclear solo uh so
finally i was like okay people are
confusing
literally you know like i gotta come up
with a name with this [ __ ] so i'm
talking to my subscribers i'm talking to
my friends we're trying to come up with
names
and there were the different ideas the
goal was to increase the amount of
nuclei on the muscle
so we started brainstorming and it's f i
was i would never forget that night
because we were coming up with the most
stupidest
corniest names nucleus emulsification
that was too wack and kony
maximum nucleus nucleus accumulation
nucleus overload and
nuclear surplus nucleus overture we're
literally brainstorming names going on
google typing synonyms
of like uh accumulation and
multiplication to just look for
something that sounded cool enough
and finally i was like you know what the
best sound they want to me is nuclear
overload obviously
overlord has two meanings right there's
overload as in like weight
right something that's just too heavy
and there's also the word overload the
you know the noun as in
um too much of something right uh for
example when you say information
overload
you don't mean there's a lot of [ __ ]
weight of information you just mean
there's too much information you know
when you say electrical overload or iron
overload i mean somebody has too much
iron
or or you see a bunch of cats and cute
pictures you're like oh look
that's cuteness overload or something
when somebody has too much testosterone
what do we say we say
stats on overload so overload is not
just weight it also means
excessive amount look it up so that that
led to a huge confusion because
everyone thinks that that same study
that i literally made a video about
is where the name comes from because
look it's easy to say you know and i
i put the square here so you just say oh
look myonuclei
uh acquired by overload exercise
procedure people they're like oh look
look there's the word overload here
and it's the word nuclear here oh so
that's why he got nuclear overload wrong
why the hell would i literally show you
guys a study and then
use keywords from the title to literally
create a name and say oh look i coined
it that makes no [ __ ] sense
and for those who don't know overload
exercise is something that scientists
use a lot when they're just referring to
weight
in fact i put some pictures here look
overload exercise
another one over a little exercise it's
literally something that they use when
they're referring to
resistance training or usually do you
know like i said you know injuring a
rash lag
and or putting something heavy on it has
nothing to do with you know
nucleus overload itself right and again
the reason why i use the word
nucleus instead of nuclei which is
because nucleus just sounds better like
no one wants to [ __ ] say nuclei or
just [ __ ] it sounds [ __ ] [ __ ] so
no
that's not where nuclear solo comes from
like literally i have
people tell me oh me oh make it look is
that where nicola solo comes from like
my nuclear
like do you speak english like that's
that's not what the sans is saying
anyway so in fact if you if you look at
the study you see like it's
literally explaining the phenomenon of
muscle memory you know they're not
saying anything about training for 30
days or
resetting him tonight all right so next
another reason why is the name confusion
is because one the study that i just
mentioned number two
so when i took a break from youtube uh
someone called greg knuckles beauty or
not i had no idea who the hell this guy
was
my subscribers are the ones who send me
everything you know because i stay away
from them
you guys know me like i have a big i
really really don't like the fitness
industry so
whenever i'm doing research it's usually
on studies
or on animals or biology books whatever
i stay away from you know famous
articles because to me 90 of my bs some
some of these guys are good some of the
researchers are good like like uh like
brad
but most of them i avoid so i had no
clue who this guy was so my subscriber
sent this to me
years ago now like oh look uh someone
made an article about nicholas overload
but they didn't give you credit
what are you talking about so i read the
article right and it was
literally describing every single thing
that i
researched about nucleus of the lord
word for [ __ ] word
right and there's not a single mention
of me in there now of course
i'm not the one who actually did the
[ __ ] studies i wasn't the guy in the
lab whatever
but it's it's crazy ironic
how the person mentioned the mtor reset
which again was a study that was
completely different in them than the
rat study and mentioned pretty much
every single thing they even mentioned
the two to four week you know take a
break and come back and
you're gonna be resensitized and grow
like the title is even grow like a new
lifter again
which is literally everything that i've
been preaching about nuclear solo
so and and i looked at a city and i was
like what the [ __ ]
like how do you literally plagiarize
somebody's hard-ass work
right every time i mention something you
know i mentioned a study
i put the link in the description i
mentioned the person i learned from
in this article there's not a single
mention of team through the alpha
and i don't care what nobody says to
myself some people are like oh
megan it could have been a coincidence
maybe they came to the same conclusion
you did and i'm like really
[ __ ] in 2015
right after the nucleus went viral
somehow someone
coincidentally finds all that research
and comes to the very same conclusion
but anyway i'm gonna give the person the
benefit of that like i said i don't know
that person uh you know
maybe it was a coincidence maybe it
wasn't i find it
very unlikely you guys can go to the
website and read that article it's
literally like word for word
all the videos that i did in 2011 2012
and 2013 about nucleus of but
you know benefit of that and also the
reason why there's a lot of confusion
about the name is
this fake ass website i gotta find out
who this is
uh my subscribers send this to me again
myself send me everything i'm going to
show you guys my my
facebook fan page but they literally
sent me everything they find that's
either fishy
or sometimes just good information and
somebody literally made a nucleus of a
little website
that i'm not affiliated with so guys if
you if you go on this website that's not
me i'm not affiliated with them make
sure you don't purchase anything from
there
in fact i'm going to contact that person
whenever i get a chance and get this
train now
nucleus overlord is my [ __ ] i coined
that term
trademark do not be fooled by because
it's funny how before
no one believed it everyone was bashing
it you know saying i was an idiot i
don't know what i was talking about
and now that so many studies are backing
it up now everyone is hopping on the
bandwagon
and literally not even giving credit the
only people who gave credit
was my obviously my subs they were the
ones that were with me since day one
when everyone was like oh megan is full
of [ __ ] he doesn't know what he's
talking about there's no science behind
it
they're the ones who are like you know
what megan there's no science behind it
but
you know here's my story here's my story
everyone was sending me the before and
after pictures
uh the the examples that they read about
a lot of these examples actually came
from our subs as well
right and of course after destiny alex
malfoy destiny
he believed it from day one he even told
me he was like hey you know i should do
mountain climbing and then when i
started by the building my phone was in
my back took off all that stuff
and obviously uh recently scott herman
messaged me
i actually thought this guy was a date
to be honest um so i wasn't even
subscribed to him
but you know he's actually cool guy he
messed with me and he was like hey you
know you know i find a lot of research
on your stuff
um you know and we went back and forth
really cool guy you know and
eventually you know he made a video
about it went into detail you see
so some people in the fitness community
still have honor
right still have some you know some
amount of respect left but some
clearly just love plagiarizing but hey
the [ __ ] do i know right so that's it
guys
it's called nucleus overload it's not
nuclear overload it's not my nuclear
overlord right don't change the name
i know some people like just didn't know
because like i said you know there's a
bunch of [ __ ] you know
um scammers and plagiarizers and [ __ ] um
but it's nucleus of lord and i picked
that name for a reason
um no it didn't come from from the title
here right like i said you could
actually fact check this if you don't
believe me
it works if you're naughty if you
enhance
there's overwhelming amount of anecdotes
there's
way too many before and after results
there's a [ __ ] ton of studies
and now another thing about subscribers
are sending me
is uh they're saying that older
everybody used to do it
right um and i got to do some research
on that because again like you guys know
me when i study something i gotta take
my time and spend
hours if not days and weeks into it um
and i can't find a lot of sources on it
there's one guy who has a youtube
channel
and that's the video that was sent to me
where he discusses
uh bronze era bodybuilders and stuff
like that but that's the only source i
could find so far
so i'm hoping that he's actually right
because like i said like you could go on
my channel and watch all the marathon
nucleus over those stories that i did
anything that backs up nucleus overload
i'm down for just send it to me send it
to me i'm gonna make a video on it so i
gotta make
i gotta do some research on that because
so far i can't find it's very very hard
to find
any information on um older bodybuilders
uh but that guy's trying to finance
since i have a lot of videos on that but
i said i gotta find time to
you know look into it if that's true
then that literally brings even
more evidence to back up nucleus
overload if that's true and i'm hoping
that it's true and i'm hoping some you
know scan bs
um and again beware of quote-unquote
experts right anyone who says that he's
an expert unless they have a no if they
have an open mind fine listen to them
right
that's what like i said you know like
some experts i listen to as long as they
have an open mind
but anyone who just says i'm an expert i
know this doesn't whatever and they
can't back it up
or they have expert bias where they
can't admit that they're wrong tell them
to [ __ ] up
right because now a lot of these
[ __ ] you know we used to say
that it didn't work whatever
are slowly trying to hop on the
bandwagon right get lost
um and of course think for yourself
don't be afraid to think outside the box
you know and don't fall and succumb
to confirmation bias don't look for
things that just back up what you want
to see
you know if you guys see the research on
this overlord i went everywhere i looked
at like i said animals i looked at
people that had bad genetics i looked at
sports i looked at cancer i mean
think outside the box right that's how
you stay ahead of the game and that's
why if you notice
i was right right science is not only
science caught up
it's proving that high reps do work
occlusion training obviously it's been
around forever
and look now years later almost
everybody's doing full body workouts
almost everybody's preaching more and
more frequency almost everybody's
preaching that
volume is more important than just
focusing on strength alone
you know because like i said strength is
important right progress overload is
going to happen regardless right
but volume is the main driver and i've
been saying that for you
so see guys don't be afraid to think for
yourself eventually
if you have enough evidence or case
studies to back up what you believe
eventually the science will catch on all

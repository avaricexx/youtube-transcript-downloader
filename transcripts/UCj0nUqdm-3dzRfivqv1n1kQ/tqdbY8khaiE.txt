hey guys going on Megan here let's go
how much fatty fish do you eat per day
for maximum testosterone muscle and
strength this is
one of the poles that I normally put up
on the channel I try to put on at least
once a day
um but anyway so let's see how unhealthy
uh mostly you [ __ ] are all right so
less than two ounces so that's Amigo
category by the way quick table of
contents for this video I'm gonna go
over the results of the poll I'm gonna
read the comments not all of them but
usually the top comments answer some
frequently asked questions
and um
I'm gonna explain to you guys exactly
how much fish you need and why blah blah
blah I'm not gonna go into too many
details to avoid making a video to
um
to Scientific but anyway
less than two ounces a day 67 percent
guys this is frightening this is
frightening in fact before I even show
you before I even read the results uh
let me quickly explain why you gotta eat
fatty fish right and you don't need a
huge amount you know you don't need a
lot of fatty fish you just need a small
amount uh the main reason it's not just
the B vitamins right obviously salmon
um sardines mackerel have a lot of B
vitamins but you could get this B
vitamins from red meat any other foods
that I recommend it's mainly for omega-3
fatty acids and I made a lot of video
about Omega-3s you could look them up
you could look at the literature on
omega-3 fatty acids is vast you could go
down a rabbit hole been there done that
omega-3 fatty acids are so first of all
your body cannot make them right your
body cannot make a omega-3 poo fish
don't go don't confuse them with omega-6
right because those we actually eat too
much of
Omega-3s are important for obviously
most of protein synthesis for
testosterone production for inflammation
which is one of the biggest benefits
heart health cholesterol HDL LDL balance
you name it right and it is also very
hard to get enough Omega-3s from the
other sources
um and that's why fatty fish comes in
right just eating a small amount of
salmon or sardines
um a mackerel is going to give you a
potent dose of Omega-3s and if you go to
chronometer and you put your typical day
of eating I guarantee you you're not
getting enough Omega-3s right so you're
walking around with chronically High
inflammation
um not to mention the effects that
omega-3 has on your cognition your your
energy levels all these things if you
guys notice I only focus on nutrients
that have multiple multiple multiple
um effects on the body now just oh this
gives you more energy no I like
nutrients that give you energy muscle
protein synthesis strength testosterone
motivation dopamine you name it right
and Omega-3s all right you have to eat I
keep reminding you guys Omega-3s are up
there
um and no I don't want to hear well I
guess some fish oil that that's not good
enough once again that's not good enough
supplements or backup plan not a plan
eight but anyway so you need
for most people depending on how active
you are you need about I would say three
to four ounces right a fatty fish I use
salmon because it's pretty much the king
if you look at everything I just
Omega-3s
um but I could also be sardines if you
don't like salmon and trust me most
people don't like fish I get it but
that's not an excuse right you got to
get your Omega-3s guys but you need
about three to four ounces
um just to get enough Omega-3s epa's
into shades for all the benefits that I
mentioned and of course there's an
inverter you curve you don't want to
just overeat uh salmon right because
then you're gonna be you're not gonna
have enough room in your Macros for the
other foods such as eggs and red meat
and you know oysters and milk that have
their own benefits
so three to four ounces and look where
most people are
keep in mind uh this is not the U.S
population it's just a small percentage
of my subscribers
but that's what makes it even scarier is
because you [ __ ] should be you
know these are people that actually want
to improve their lives but yet look how
low you score on things that are so
crucial for health look at this
70 of you [ __ ] are in a single
Academy meaning less than two ounces of
fatty fish
per day right and this is an average
right so it doesn't mean you have to eat
three to four ounces every single day
right you could eat maybe eight ounces
one day and then I eat it for two days
and then eat again like as long as on
average on a seven day average you hear
you're good to go but look at that 70
percent
right uh eating less than two ounces
probably even zero I should have put
zero to one ounce to see right because
most of you guys probably have zero
um nine percent are eating about two
ounces right only ten percent
of the people who voted on this pole are
eating about three to four ounces right
and again 15 are getting more than four
ounces these are some scary numbers and
I'm not surprised if you look at the
research it's even worse than this you
know if you look at the the studies on
omega-3 consumption even if you factor
in fish oil supplements most people are
not getting enough right and once again
these are things that our ancestors
didn't have to worry about they didn't
have to worry about oh did I get enough
Omega-3s right because they're getting
their hunters and gatherers they got
meat they got fish they got their hands
on everything they pretty much ate
whatever they could get their hands on
right and Fish by the way if your
ancestors were close to Rivers was an
abundant source of uh nutrients for
these [ __ ] but let's look at the
comments and see what's going on
all right first comment I love Seafood
salmon has always been an ad for me but
I knew a guy growing up who always had
fresh called salmon in his house oh
that's a lucky month for his family
literally had four fridges full of
salmon that they had caught and that
dude was tall lean and smart as hell I
bet you respond absolutely and again I'm
not making [ __ ] up you guys could do the
research I always say this whenever I
say something you guys think is absurd
you best believe that I've done a
ridiculous amount of research in the
last decade or so before I even have the
balls to open up my mouth and talk about
this right I'm not most of your freaking
uh ignorant ass influencers who read one
study or just go off you know the
experience alone right I want to make
sure that if I'm going to influence
somebody's decision
I want to make sure there is something
that's time tested both from the
empirical side and uh the actual
research so yeah I mean this is not
surprising that people who eat a lot of
fish
um you know uh getting the nutrients or
smarter or stronger whatever
um not so interesting you also getting a
lot of vitamin D from salmon even though
you need a lot more than that next uh
here definitely most of the people are
going in this
most other people are going to smiggler
category growing up I remember myself
begging my mother to cook fish guys I
have a whole video planned on this on
how so many parents whether accidentally
on purpose of [ __ ] so many of the
kids up right a lot of you guys watching
the video I'm not saying this for you to
be upset at your parents because maybe
they didn't know any better but that's
also not an excuse they should have done
the [ __ ] research when you have a kid
you gotta like learn how to optimize the
development but you'd be surprised of
how much stronger smarter taller
whatever you'll be if your parents were
serious about your nutrition when you
were a child oh I have a whole video on
this because I could show you if I show
you the studies in the meta-analysis on
that you would cry you would cry
when you realize how much the nutrition
or the lack of attention your parents
put on your nutrition when you're
growing up [ __ ] you today now once
again before the black pale
[ __ ] run in and try to give up
no that's not an excuse to give up and
be like oh look you know I'm not because
you know play with the hands you with
that like I would say all right if your
parents [ __ ] you over by giving you
shitty nutrition it's not too late you
know there's still some ways you can
optimize your your life right you guys
know my mentality team do the alpha no
excuses always find a way to overcome
the obstacles but it helps to know that
um your parents did [ __ ] you over so
that you don't repeat that mistake
um you'd be surprised how many kids out
here
tell me hey Megan I'm trying to eat eggs
my my mom won't let me uh because
they're still believing 50 year old
research about eggs and cholesterol and
people saying Hey I want more red meat
but my mom is going to give me vegan
food or oh man they are [ __ ] you guys
up so much especially if you're going
through puberty that's the worst you're
going through puberty that's when you
want to be on point with sleep and
nutrition
you only go to puberty once
[ __ ] like you don't want to
[ __ ] around with puberty you know
um so I feel bad for you guys to have uh
you know I call it abusive parents even
if the parents don't mean to abuse you
they're abusing you they're giving you
[ __ ] food and they refuse to uh to uh to
fuel your development to fuel your
hormones doing puberty uh make sure you
have maximum androgens DHEA testosterone
even DHT then
it should be child abuse my opinion
but anyway here definitely most people
are going to swimmingo I remember my mom
took a favor but she never did it
because it was too expensive look at
that look at that [ __ ] too expensive
it's too expensive to invest in your
child you know parents are some parents
are so [ __ ] selfish man like it blows
my mind they act like they love their
kids but we'll get a [ __ ] dog the
same parents will probably spend that
money on some [ __ ] president or some
[ __ ] dress uh [ __ ] makeup um kid
than to buy salmon for the kids
anyway I used to eat fish one time per
week me again we counted 48 ounces of
beef ounces of salmon six eggs a day I
don't want to hear this [ __ ] you knew
what I was gonna say when I read this
guy mccormone excuses excuses excuses
you wanna know why number one
you [ __ ] are playing fortnite
you [ __ ] are buying the latest
game that cost 59.99 plus the
microtransactions right I hate this [ __ ]
so much man I hate excuses all my
friends will tell you you want me to
sell an excuse I will [ __ ] roast you
right you can't afford to buy beef
ounces of salmon whatever but I
guarantee you you could buy uh again
video games you have uh subscriptions to
streaming services you have if you
actually budget your money
the right way you have a lot of money
left over to invest in your health
you can't spend 60 bucks on the next
Call of Duty game but to talk about oh I
can't afford beef what
where's your money going and if you
don't have enough money again that's
still your fault get a job work
I hate excuses man killing the floor
today
anyway the microplastics is increasing
your fission if you buy organic yeah I
mean but you could say that about every
food I already told you guys every food
has something bad about it everything
even eggs even red meat even even
oysters all the foods that I recommend
even the healthiest foods in the world
I've done a research there's something
bad about it right you can find a study
that shows you that milk is bad you can
find a study that shows you salmon is
bad because of the Mercury there's
something bad in every food the key is
to look at the pros and the cons right
and then to pick what has the most net
benefits you're not going to find a
single food source
that comes with no cons
but um but anyway
um and trust me being deficient you know
Omega-3s is a lot worse than having to
worry about those little details but uh
but yeah this comment definitely made me
mad man and again I'm not trying to be
harsh on you guys it's just I don't like
excuses man I don't like excuses now
maybe there is some [ __ ] out there
somewhere in the world we can't afford
that that stuff but it's not you
right if you're on YouTube
you got a smartphone or a computer you
could afford beef salmon and eggs if you
can't do six then three do something but
please don't give me excuses man that it
goes against everything seem to the
alpha stands for
all right next
um
yeah yeah dude oh dude that video is so
old how do you remember this [ __ ] bro
yeah man and again great example of
don't make excuses I actually don't like
the taste of salmon I actually don't
like fish unless it's on Sushi it's a
whole different story um but unless
there's some sushi I could eat anything
on Sushi
um I eat [ __ ] fried balls on sushi
but
um I don't like salmon but what did I do
years ago you guys can see the video
team do that fun mentality I started
doing research on how to make salmon
taste better and I found out that you
can make some bomb fried rice and this
and you know there's always a way right
just like I [ __ ] hate liver but yeah
I eat one ounce of liver almost every
day you know me and my girlfriend ways
to make it taste good you know uh but
anyway so learn how to cook one fried
rice where are you coming to garlic
butter onion powder oysters dude you
remember this
even I forgot about that video bro
that's what's up you know
um
let's see it used to be around 100 grams
every single day but as I've learned
about the benefits of red meat and eggs
there's the most room uh so that's about
100 a day I mean that's fine that's fine
even if it's every other day it's better
than nothing right whenever I recommend
these Foods
um that doesn't mean you have to do it
every single day I mean people are so
like
extreme you know if I say oh do this
every day everyone thinks it means
Monday through Sunday with zero days off
it's like I'm like all right you know do
five minutes on that muscle uh every day
and people think it means literally
Monday through Sunday no day off if
you're sick if your mom died you gotta
go to the funeral you got to bring your
dumbbell with you no guys it's okay to
take a day or two off here and there it
just means make it a habit
you know so yeah if you're getting every
other day trust me that's a lot better
than
not getting at all
so this is a bit different for me I get
six ounces of salmon a week since I
consume eight ounces of ground beef
a day
um and four to five eggs along with
I mean
yeah yeah yeah I mean you're getting
your [ __ ] and eight that's the ground
beef let's go this is the legend right
there Sigma gotta get your red meat
um bro wants me to eat everything every
day dude it's the same Foods man it's
the same foods that I always talk about
so not everything it's again eggs red
meat salmon those are the top three
right those are the kings and then you
could add a sorry a little bit of beef
flavor because you only need like an
ounce or half an ounce
excuse me and um if you could afford it
a little bit of oysters but you don't
even need number four number five as
long as you have the top three right and
obviously as far as the drinks go milk
you guys don't have a lot of videos of
milk uh if you uh take lactose-free milk
if you lactose in time or whatever but
it's the same Foods guys it's the same
foods every time I even talk about a new
vitamin what what you guys think is a
new vitamin because it's really old as
[ __ ] but what if I mentioned vitamin or
mineral or whatever you'll notice it's
the same foods that have it right get
your Meats pause you know get get your
fruits get your nuts get your veggies
guys this is not new your ancestors were
doing this without even thinking
what is so hard about eat berries and
fruits for your antioxidants and
potassium and you know vitamin C what's
the hard about eat spinach and kale and
broccoli for your fiber and your uh your
dim your your anti-estrogenic compounds
right
it's about having a colorful plate
veggies fruits meat and then as far as
carbs go pick pick I said peak pick
healthy carb sauces potatoes quinoa
right
and then you just rotate you know
balance balance meal plan you don't got
to be a slave to this [ __ ] but it's all
about eating healthy
so you can fuel your workout so you can
recover from your workout so you could
have uh you could reduce your ADHD
symptoms which I mainly do to you know
not enough time not enough choline
but anyway I'm going after changing here
um and again I also noticed that a lot
of the things to Max T also things to
help with growth as it changes it that's
exactly what I was just saying that's
exactly the point how to make it you'll
notice that if you go deep enough in a
rabbit hole of optimizing health and
testosterone and muscle mass and all
this [ __ ] that I've studied over the
last decade you'll see that it's the
same things they're all related
things that optimize testosterone and
muscle mass and fat loss are things that
optimize growth and cognition
because once again these are [ __ ] that
our ancestors have to do for hundreds of
thousands of years
we've evolved to strive on those foods
but yeah great observation great
observation is actually true yeah a lot
of things are interconnected
um which is also why I'll I always
recommend foods that have multiple uh
you know functions you know things that
help you with for example eggs eggs are
going to help you with muscle mass
testosterone fat loss strain cognition
you know red meat muscle mass
testosterone strength energy cognition
you know beef liver on and on
uh I do a lot of guys you should see the
research I do before I even recommend
something to a client I have so so and
I'm not saying this to brag it's just
this is my life's passion I love this
[ __ ] I have so much data on the things
that I talk about
um anyway major part of my diocese I'm
pescetarian nice nice eating half a
pound of salmon every day that's pretty
good you don't need to eat every day
because then we get three stores in the
body yeah I mean I already said that
earlier
um
let's see amen I finally got sounds so
sus finally got my meat intake up
uh time for my uh G wait what time for
more fatty fish salmon twice a week I
eat fish once a week to be honest um
that's that's still better than than
nothing right I'd rather have you eat
fish once a week or every other day than
zero um because you'd be surprised look
at the average person's chronometer and
um they're getting no Omega-3s man
they're omega-6 Omega-3 ratio is
diabolical it's like 20 to 1 10-15 and
one it should be closer to two to one if
not one to one
um let's see
um I get my money from chia seeds yeah
but you gotta eat a [ __ ] temperature she
used to get that plus chia seeds come
with their own issues and anti-nutrients
or whatever but that's something for a
different video to be honest I don't eat
a lot of fatty fish but I suck consume
115 grams of fat a day on average
um well good thing is you're getting
enough fats which Everybody's scared of
you know even though you do any fats but
the bad thing is if you don't eat a lot
of fatty fish you'll make it six to
three ratio is probably [ __ ] like I
just mentioned
um but uh at least you're getting your
fats in you know Mom don't let me eat
fish see you know it's that same
scenario of parents [ __ ] a kissing
ass all right great pose for okay uh
salmon season where I lived my wife and
I capture one nice nice man I'm I'm
Jelly
um what about mercury and fish again I
already mentioned that so many times
guys
uh one can of sardines a dollar no
excuses thank you
if only fish was less expensive oh my
God
oh my face like twice a week but not
daily again that's fine that's fine
twice again progress is better than no
progress right
um I rarely eat fish because I'm broke
I'm all right but that was your first
problem why are you broke you know we
live in 2023 I don't want to hit nobody
in America or UK or Australia or in a in
a developed Nation talking about it
Brooke I don't want to hear [ __ ]
there are so many ways to make money
online
um
legitimate money all right so let's see
I eat six eggs
right there I'm not gonna make a three
supplements again
I'm I'm partially happy because you're
at least eating eggs to ground beef but
you know this supplement part here is
not gonna
vote well with me you know if you're
using a supplement as a backup plan then
all the power to you in fact that's how
you should use it but I don't think that
should be your plan A
um
next I see 16 ounces of seven every day
hold on a second let me see what time it
is oh [ __ ] 20 minute video all right so
let's wrap this up quickly let's see
four ounces a month God damn I have to
say I ate a packet
Megan I can't I can only afford eggs at
McDonald's bruh
fish are probably the only meat I don't
eat
um that's no bueno let me go faster so
first off I'm not God I'm even though
I'm coming with fatty fish
uh let's see if you're in a Golem
category you uh you're smeagle man do
cancer things work too yeah yeah
sardines are you know so these are fatty
fish just make sure they're not drowning
in a bunch of seed oils
um defeat the whole purpose
three games of sardines on The Daily
um again same thing make sure they don't
have a lot of make sure they're not in
soybean or some [ __ ] that's the
worst thing ever I can you imagine
sardines in soybean oil what the whole
point is to get your omega-3 to six
ratio fixed and then they just put them
in a can full of soybean oil
do oysters count
um I mean you're getting some but not as
much
uh oyster serve a different purpose they
give you a lot of zinc obviously a lot
of enough copper as well to offset the
zinc to Copper imbalance
um and you're getting some omega-3sion
oysters but
wait a minute is the whole fish American
dude you'd be surprised at how many
scams are out there you guys were lied
don't get me wrong some anyway I make a
whole different separate video about
Mercury if you want
I don't consume any aquatic food because
of mercury oh my God
um what about Plastics okay yeah that
definitely calls for video
clearing up these misconceptions
um and trust me guys every scam every
myth has a small element of truth to it
that's why I spread so fast so I'm going
to clarify
there's just a lot of people just blow
it out of proportion
but anyway uh let's see if there's any
top comments there's no way I'm going to
read all this [ __ ]
uh fish is disgusting you disgusting
[ __ ] um Bros really straight for me
dude it's not all this [ __ ] this is
actually pretty basic stuff man uh it's
pretty much summery eat healthy you know
so it is
um
all right but anyway so I think that's
it let's move on to the next video the

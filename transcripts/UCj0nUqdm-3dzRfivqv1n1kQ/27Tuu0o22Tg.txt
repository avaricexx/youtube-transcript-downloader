hey guys going on megan here another
episode of taylor's tuesday
uh you guys wanted me to go over
vitamins and minerals so let's get to it
now first of all take your multivitamin
and throw it in the trash all right
most multivitamins are trash right they
don't give you enough of the ones that
you need
or they give you too much of the ones
you don't need not to mention the whole
vitamins the minerals competing for
absorption thing right so most
multivitamins are trash so get rid of
your multivitamin
and it's best you actually get them from
food or you get them separately
and again obviously you guys know the
importance of vitamins and minerals
right they're not optional most people
think they're the optional when they're
not in fact
most people that i run into are
completely deficient in the key vitamins
and minerals which is insane because
they have such a huge impact on your
health your strength your ability to put
on muscle your
energy levels everything right so a lot
of you guys thinking hey um
i need more coffee or i need more of
this or i feel like [ __ ] all the time my
t levels are trash
your vitamins and minerals are lacking
right and it's due to five main reasons
number one like i mentioned most
multivitamins are trash
number two most people have a shitty
diet not enough fruits and vegetables
number three even if you eat enough
fruits and vegetables chances are you're
not getting enough vitamins and minerals
because our soil is trash
and lastly most people forget that
minerals especially minerals
um have a very very low body
availability right not all of them but
the vast majority same same thing with
vitamins too right so just because
you're taking let's say a thousand
milligrams of xyz
that does not mean that your body's
using all of that right a lot of these
vitamins and minerals have very low
bioavailability
so that's why most people are deficient
but anyway so let's rank them according
to
uh the most anabolic ones meaning the
ones that directly influence protein
synthesis
all right let's get started so borrow
i'm gonna put bro on that okay right the
main benefit of bronzer is mainly
uh reducing sexual mobility globally
increasing free testosterone
um but i'm not to put a high on the list
because it's not anabolic per se right
but it will help you indirectly
next calcium obviously calcium is going
to go to [ __ ] amazing right you can
be deficient in calcium
it's obviously important for muscle
contractions protein synthesis
in fact one of the ways in which
testosterone acts
is by increasing intracellular calcium
so obviously without calcium no
contractions
and shitty bone density all right next
magnesium is in i'm about another
category right
almost everyone is deficient in
magnesium which is insane because it's
so important for insulin sensitivity
testosterone levels protein sentences
you name it right so
i'm about to another category also keep
in mind guys i do not
recommend any of these brands i'm not
sponsored by any of these [ __ ]
i literally just went online
and looked up the first snapshot i could
find right so you'll notice a lot of
these basic ass companies i'm not
sponsored by any of them
and i'm not recommending i'm not saying
they're good or bad i'm literally just
using their pictures
to make this video as fast as possible
all right next selenium is going to be
in okay
you can get that from brazil and that's
literally like one or two brazil nuts
and you got all your selenium for the
day
um next vitamin c [ __ ] amazing very
important for recovery
antioxidant properties now obviously you
don't want to overdose right because
it's going to hinder
your growth adaptation so don't overdose
on vitamin c just get enough to up your
recovery and your immune system and so
forth
iron is obviously okay very few people
are deficient in iron anyway right
unless you're a vegan or some [ __ ] right
but
i'm gonna put an okay category obviously
you guys know why i do it helps with
energy red blood cells blah blah
all right next potassium i'm going to
potassium are [ __ ] amazing right
so many people are deficient in
potassium i think it's like 90 to 100 of
people
um and again very important for optimal
performance muscle growth protein
synthesis
vitamin k i'm gonna put that okay very
important for bone density
and insulin sensitivity um but it's not
anabolic per se right
chromium i'm gonna put that one that
[ __ ] amazing because almost
everybody's deficient in chromium and
it's very very important for insulin
sensitivity
um next zinc obviously zinc is an i'm
about to nut category especially for
your bodybuilder which is what this
video is for anyway right
very important for your immune system
for bone testosterone protein sentences
managing sex homo body globulin estrogen
you name it right so i'm about to
another category
iodine i'm about to nut category
extremely important
especially for your thyroid obviously i
made a lot of videos in the past about
t3 t4 that [ __ ] but
again over 80 of your body's iodine is
located in your thyroid gland right
which shows you how important it is
right for t3 function
so a lot of you guys thinking hey my
metabolism is slow how do i speed it up
what chances are you deficient in iodine
um but again if you if you're eating
iodized salt chances are you're getting
enough
next vitamin a [ __ ] amazing so
important for so many functions
including your immune system believe it
or not everyone thinks of vitamin c
obviously your eyesight uh but it also
plays a role in protein synthesis
and uh testosterone function b complex
i'm about to nut right and i just put
all the b vitamins into one right
you cannot be deficient in your b
vitamins right and obviously everyone
knows what they're mainly known for
which is obviously energy production
right so again if you feel like [ __ ] all
the time
make sure you're not deficient in your
vitamin b they do a bunch of other
things but they're mainly known for
energy production
phosphorus i'm going to put that one in
okay right mainly known for dna
synthesis protein synthesis
and obviously bone health vitamin e
again i'm gonna put that one in okay
known for its antioxidant properties
um vitamin d3 you guys really know where
this is going if you watch my video on
sunlight
um this is the king and again remember
guys this is not a vitamin it's a
[ __ ] hormone it's a steroid hormone
you cannot be deficient in vitamin d i'm
not going to go into details because
this video is going to be way too long
but watch my video on sunlight
you cannot be deficient in vitamin d so
hormone guys
it's not just for bone it's not just for
calcium i think it's crucial for
satellite cell activation lowering
myostatin
increasing protein synthesis improving
insulin sensitivity increasing your
strength
optimizing your neurotransmitters i mean
i could go on and on and on and on this
is the most
important thing on this entire list here
right you cannot be deficient
environment
especially if you don't spend enough
time outside chances are you're
deficient in that right
next chloride i'm gonna put that one out
okay everyone is getting enough
especially if you obviously put salt on
your [ __ ]
all right manganese believe it or not
i'm gonna put that one that [ __ ]
amazing
right very important and very underrated
mineral
that has a ton of uses in the human body
from enzyme
antioxidant properties insulin
sensitivity again most of your sex
hormones
your lipid metabolism glucose metabolism
amino acids
you name it right this mineral is very
very underrated
i'm gonna put that one [ __ ] amazing
uh chloride i'm gonna put that one out
okay everyone's getting enough chloride
colleen extremely important for your
energy for
for lipid transport your
neurotransmitters building your cell
membranes blah blah blah
but it's not directly anabolic it's not
really going to boost protein synthesis
too much i'm going to put that one at
okay um copper everyone's familiar with
copper's role in energy so i'm going to
put that one in okay here somewhere
and obviously fluoride man that's the
only one i was going to put that bad up
your garbage but obviously
we don't want to put any of those things
in battle pier garbage i'm just going to
put it right here
all right so that's it guys i'll try to
make this video as quick as possible
these are your most
anabolic vitamins and minerals i'm about
to know you vitamin d3
magnesium zinc iodine your b complex
uh [ __ ] amazing you have your calcium
vitamin c potassium
chromium vitamin a manganese and then
everything here is okay right so i'm not
saying it's okay to be the official in
the ones that are down here
right obviously you don't want to be
deficient in anything but the ones in
the top two tiers you
definitely don't want to be deficient in
right if your goal is to maximize
strength and muscle growth all right

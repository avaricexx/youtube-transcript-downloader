3d on deck
and that's the rice that we normally eat
and i'll show you guys how to make this
open up your rice we eat a lot of rice
in this house a lot of rice
that's what most of our mash comes from
the house oh [ __ ]
rice is very healthy guys first thing
you want to do is you want to put your
rice in the second thing you want to do
i'm subscribed because you want to clean
your rice throw some cold water on
watch your dirty ass hand you probably
pee in your meat earlier
next thing you want to do is you want to
grab this thing here you actually need a
drainer
wash it a second time yeah
it's kind of creepy right after you wash
your rice
you want to put just enough water to
cover the rice
also guys remember we're cooking brown
rice now white rice so you might
actually need a little bit more water
because it takes a lot longer to cook
so put the water in there that's what it
should look like
and also you want to grab some olive oil
all right guys next thing you want to do
is you want to dice up just just half of
a tomato
and a little bit of onions you can use
green onions as you can tell
and let's look at our pot here now so
far we have rice
water and some olive oil and don't
forget to add your salt
and just throw it in the rice cooker
press cook
close it down that's what it should look
like by the way
close it and that technology do the job
don't forget to check your brown rice
every once in a while
flip it okay guys here's the final
result
you have your brown rice you have your
chicken you have your peas
healthy meal protein carbs veggies
and your bottle of water of course and
like i said you can make this in the
morning or at night
put it into a lot of bowls close them up
put them in your bag and take them to
work with you you know don't forget your

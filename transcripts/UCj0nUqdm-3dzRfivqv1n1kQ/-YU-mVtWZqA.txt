hey guys going on megan here 25
push you're not eating enough protein
this is probably going to be the most
important video you'll ever see on
protein if not the best video
all right let's get straight to it
bodybuilder of the day is nicer else
somebody
one of the best bodybuilders of all time
robbed at the 97 mr olympia
hype was 511 weight 290 that gave him an
rm ratio of 57.
and to put that in perspective guys
arnold was 37
uh his rm was 37 phil he's rm was 41
and obviously the current mr olympia
brandon curry is 46
so nacer was a beast very very
underrated
and i feel like he should have had that
one mr olympia
before he's on time leave that for you
know rest in peace but anyway guys so
back to the topic of this video
protein i am so sick of the so-called
experts
telling people that they're not getting
you know they're getting enough protein
or you don't need to eat a high protein
diet blah blah blah
here's what i got to say about experts
guys most of them are wrong
in fact here's a list of 12 things that
i've been preaching on this channel for
almost a decade now that experts
so-called experts in quotes were wrong
right from full body workout to strength
volume
high reps pump drug you name it they
were wrong on almost
every single type in fact every those 12
topics that i put here
they're wrong why it's not because i'm
smarter because i'm obviously not
it's just when somebody calls themselves
an expert instantly
they're attached with that they're
contaminated with expert buyers meaning
they refuse to be wrong so even if they
find out that holy [ __ ]
you know there's new evidence that shows
that i'm wrong they refuse to say
because
you know the ego gets in the way right
so the moment somebody tells me
i'm an expert and i have this many
qualifications
i try not to listen to them in fact most
of the time i'll just skip it right
because they're going to be full of [ __ ]
and they're not going to give you the
ultimate truth that's why there's so
much
[ __ ] information in the fitness
industry and you got a guy like me
who has no degree in [ __ ] of you know
um
all these [ __ ] fancy ass finished
things but was literally right on almost
every single thing that everyone is
preaching now
from full body workouts to frequency to
think and now this video is going to be
on protein and you'll see
right it's because i'm not
[ __ ] biased right i'm passionate
about hypertrophy i'm passionate about
muscle growth so
i pull information from animals from
people from different cultures different
genetics different sports
and i always look for what they have in
common that's why i'm always ahead of
the game
so avoid people that have one good
genetics again every
almost everything that they do works
people that are obviously enhanced
and people that claim to be experts
unless
they're humble experts you know that's
why i love brad you know brad schoenfeld
because
yes he's an expert but he's actually
humble he's not afraid to admit that
he's wrong
and he's not afraid to literally keep
you know um adding to his research and
constantly seeking the truth so be very
careful
but anyway let's go into the first slide
so full body workouts right here's the
number one reason
why most people are not eating enough
protein so again when you're doing full
body workouts your body requires more
protein
right and again i've been you finally
you found all these videos because i've
been talking about this for years
right and at the time i didn't have to
have a study
to back that up i i told you guys using
common sense if you're just training
chess or you're just training
triceps you're doing a typical splay
routine how much protein do you actually
need not as much right
because your protein sensitive response
is not as elevated
because you're only stimulating a small
percentage of your body
but when you're training full body or
high frequency or very high volume
your protein requirement goes up that
people are saying well there's no you
know there's no study to back this up
this is brawl science and this
and that and sure enough right uh i
think it was yeah there it goes
mcnaughton right made a study recently
showing that holy [ __ ] you know because
back then we used to think 20 grams
was enough to max out more protein
sentences 20 grams per
per meal and now we find out no if you
do full body workouts
you actually need double that amount bam
40 grams of protein in that study and
that was regardless of body weight
right and which makes [ __ ] sense guys
did you need a study to tell you this
i was telling you guys this for years
it's just common sense if you're going
through the dream you're training chest
back triceps
you know shoulders like like all these
body parts quads
hamstrings in one day there's no way in
hell
you should be eating the same amount of
protein as the average person
next igf-1 right very poor in fact i'm
gonna start going a lot faster because
venus already have four minutes
actually it's waiting one to four
minutes um so protein synthetic right so
igf-1 which is again one of the most
anabolic peptides in the body
is protein sensitive in fact when people
have cancer
right they actually advise to lower
their protein intake because it's a
strong correlation
with igf-1 right but when you're trying
to put on gains you want to maximize
you know your insulin micro factor one
and of course idrif one i talk about in
every video responsible for protein
synthesis you know activating mtor
activating satellite cells increasing
your strength lowering myostatin
you're increasing your androgen receptor
activity bone density you name it right
hydrophones responsible so many things
and it's
very very sensitive to your protein
intake right so that's one reason
why i recommend very high protein
intakes you know except again there are
some exceptions where
i'm okay with giving somebody i want to
say low about moderate protein
and that exception is usually when
somebody's extremely skinny and they
want to put on a lot of mass fast and
i'm trying to increase their carbs
yeah in that case i might put them on a
little bit on the on
on the lower side of protein so they can
have more room for carbohydrates
um but other than that in fact even in
that situation they're still eating more
protein than the average
person next you know it minimizes muscle
damage
right problem with too much muscle
damage yes obviously you want some kind
of muscle damage when you're training
but not too much right because too much
muscle damage obviously means
it takes longer for your body to recover
longer for your body to recover means it
takes longer for
you to actually maximize your weekly
volume
right if you train on monday you cause
too much damage guess what you can go
back on tuesday wednesday
and train again at least not efficiently
right well high protein
diet speeds up recovery which is coming
up soon right but it minimizes the most
damage mainly through i'm not going to
go to the
boring science but mainly to taurine
carnitine alginate and things like that
right
a lot of the amino acids really help uh
you know they have antioxidant
properties
and they really help minimize muscle
damage but if you're not eating enough
protein or if you're on the low side
you're not getting those benefits right
remember volume
is the number one drive for hypertrophy
you know weekly volume of course
and the best way to increase that is to
frequency that's why i'm so big
on higher frequency but excessive damage
i should say
blunts that right next muscle protein
synthesis
is lower in trained men that's the fact
everyone knows this by now right
and of course the consensus is 1.6 grams
uh per kilogram of body weight and of
course we're finding out that it's not
enough
in fact there's a study by missoula
right which is actually showing that
trained men actually need more protein
in fact trained men who are also used to
eating you know normal protein intakes
or higher protein intakes
they actually need more protein to
maximize protein sentences
right and that came to the conclusion of
about two grams
of protein per kilogram of body weight
right and i actually recommend
way more than that but and i'm going to
show you exactly why next stride for
performance right
taurean you're going to hear me mention
about taurine and glutamine you know
i've mentioned them in almost every
video right
very very very crucial for maximizing
strength and performance now instead of
supplementing with it
how about you just increase your protein
intake so strength of performance
you know is obviously going to be
affected by your protein intake
you don't believe me go on a low protein
diet and see what happens to your
strength performance
right so you want to have you know more
strength gains better performance in the
gym
it is paramount that your protein intake
is not
you know lacking next protein synthesis
mtor out of all the bcaas out of all the
the amino acids
leucine is the most powerful at
stimulating mtor which is the main
enzyme responsible for protein synthesis
aka muscle building
that's pretty much steroids work right
one of the pathways that work is
and keeps protein synthesis elevated all
the time
as a native it is paramount that you
actually optimize your leucine intake
which is going to come from your diet
right there's no need to supplement with
leucine
get that [ __ ] from your diet next
recovery protein plays a huge role in
recovery
glycogen replenishment mainly through
glutamine and taurine right
antioxidant properties toxin removal
food digestion your gut health i have
some slides on that coming up your
immune system
right and you guys know if you see me in
the conversation i'm also my recovery
recovery recovery because almost every
question you ask me
you're gonna see me mention recovery and
right i always say it depends on your
recovery management it depends
well guess what protein is one big
factor
of your ability to recover on top of
sleep and water and the usual basic
things that i talk about
next old people old people have a
blunted response to protein synthesis
so since again studies are backing this
up as well they need higher protein
intakes
just to you know just literally have the
same amount of protein sentences that
young people do
so as you age that's another reason why
you need to increase your protein intake
next testosterone the king of anabolic
hormones
right again your androgen receptor which
is what testosterone has to bind to
actually you know to actually have its
effect
most of its effects is the number one
predictor of muscle gains meaning before
we even
put you on a workout program your
androgen receptor content is what lets
anyone know
ahead of time how you respond to that
training again that's
solute is so important i'm trying to
have you guys maximize the amount of
nuclei within your muscle because again
the more nuclear the more energy and
receptors
that's also hypodermic steroids they
increase your nuclei which obviously
increases
energy receptors but guess what
testosterone is also affected by protein
intake
to do direct mechanisms and also
indirect mechanisms
you know through igf-1 production
carnitine cortisol growth hormone you
know just
and also having a high caloric intake
which is coming up soon
because protein allows you to have a
high calorie intake even even when
you're going on the cut
next cortisol all right cortisol lowered
by product you guys know about that
everyone knows what the [ __ ] carter so
does right
having a high protein diet help you
lower cortisol
taurine there's effect on the gaba
receptor you have glutamine and i made a
long ass video on glutamine you can look
that up
the antioxidant properties you know the
liver detox effects of protein all of
those things and again of course the
whole you know the fact that protein
allows you to eat
you know to get away with higher
calories all of these things
play a role in lowering cortisol x
myosatin which is the number one muscle
killer right
well guess what protein intake helps
lower my stand higher protein intake
means you're also getting more glutamine
you're also getting more taurine right
which again are very powerful at
lowering myostatin
you're getting more leucine as i
mentioned earlier which you're going to
increase m
which is one of the things that
myostatin [ __ ] up and of course the
testosterone and growth hormone igf-1
affects the protein
is actually going to help lower my stand
as well next pump maximization
right don't worry guys that video on the
pump is coming up i'm going to make
another one
right again the pump yes the pump you
get from
training is a better predictor of her
personal feeding your actual strength
gains and
by now if you watch my videos you
already know this by now right i'm so
sick of people who kept
spitting out shitty advice for years
telling people oh you need to work
you need to increase your absolute
strength if you want to put on muscle
and this and that is
it's part of my [ __ ] [ __ ] right
and now the literature
is undivided when it comes to that it
was one of the biggest myths
in the fitness industry and some people
still preach that [ __ ] right but
anyway watch my video on um
i'm gonna put in the description or
update on this slice destroying that
myth
to the [ __ ] ground but anyway yeah so
the pump is actually a better predictor
of how much muscle you would build from
the work and obviously everything
has to be aligned right you know enough
volume enough frequency
obviously enough weight and things like
that but do not underestimate the
importance of the pump and guess what
yes
protein helps with the pump how again
through the top two right glutamine and
taurine they put water into the cell
i think i mentioned that now in a water
video or the high rep video
or no i think it's the coronavirus
anyway mention that several times right
creatine itself even again think about
creatine
one of the number one functions of
creatine a performance effects on
strength and myostatin and all that
stuff is
it's an osmolite pulls water into the
cell right and guess what creatine
is made from arginine which is
non-essential in some cases essential
and obviously methionine which which is
an essential amino acid
so you can't just rely on your body to
you know
synthesize that if you're deficient in
protein next growth hormone
through arginine right growth hormone
everyone knows by now what hgh does
right
it's protein sensitive right alginate
increases growth hormone
protein deficiency in kids think think
about that kids that grow up with low
protein diets
especially in poor countries like some
places in india some parts of africa and
things like that they end up being short
as [ __ ] right
they have growth hormone deficiencies
mainly linked to nutritional status
and protein intake all right so growth
hormone is sensitive
to your protein intake just like
hydrophone right because again growth
hormone is critical for the production
of igf-1
systemic igf-1 and of course it's going
to help you with strength recovery bone
density
losing fat all that stuff right next the
nitrogen natty curse
remember guys i mean look at the
difference here of when um
uh nasa was 90 compared to when he you
know hopped on the juice
not in there right but guess what us 90s
we have to deal with the 90 curve so
what is it
nitrogen retention right our body is
constantly trying to break down protein
when you naughty you constantly fighting
your body's
you understand your body does not want
to be sore that's why it has myostatin
it does not want to be too small because
again it burns too many calories
right and it's not efficient from a
survival standpoint unless you obviously
have a lot of food
so the body's always trying to keep you
obviously the body wants to have some
kind of muscle mass but just enough for
you to get by
that's why it only builds muscle when
you're either in a surplus of course you
can put on most of the deficit but again
that's a topic for a whole different
video you know but mainly it
only maximizes muscle growth when you're
eating a surplus or
when you expose it to extreme mechanical
stress there's a reason for that
your body does not like to put on muscle
and as the 90 you're constantly fighting
this
this battle your body's constantly
trying to break down protein the
nitrogen natty curse
is very hard for us to be in the
positive nitrogen balance
and guess what protein prevents nitrogen
loss the more protein you eat
or the more calories you eat the less
nitrogen your body
excretes right and i mentioned a three
gram rule right for you to put on a
pound of muscle a month
your body needs to synthesize three
grams of new protein a day i may have
read about that about two three no
actually about four years ago
look that up right so your body only
needs to synthesize
three grams of new protein a day for you
to put on a pound of muscle a month
yet the average person is way more than
just you know 100 150 grams of protein
so where's all that protein going most
of it is being oxidized
right your body's burning that [ __ ] your
body does not want to
retain nitrogen you know once you're an
adult
so having a higher protein intake is
going to help
mitigate that nitrogen loss that's why
people don't steroids right don't
they can actually get away with i won't
say low protein intake but
you know what would it with a medium a
moderate protein intake because the body
you know one of the functions of
steroids is obviously increasing
nitrogen retention
but we're not on the juice united's
next gorillas right and that's one of
the things that i hate hearing the most
people say oh
look at gorillas they're so big and
muscular you know they don't eat that
much protein
who the [ __ ] said that and you guys
understand you guys know me i love
animals right i'm always studying weird
ass animals lions gorillas whatever
in fact i use goodwill emojis on almost
you know every video
it used to be my background at one point
i love studying nature because in fact
that's why i get a lot of my
knowledge and wisdom from the study
nature and who the hell
came up with the myth that gorillas
don't eat enough protein let's eat a
[ __ ] ton of protein in fact keep in mind
gorillas can weigh up to 450 pounds
depending on what species low land mound
gold is whatever but they can weigh up
to 450 pounds the silverback of course
right
the biggest [ __ ] they eat up to
8 000 calories in some cases even more
and guess what most of those calories
is actually protein if they could choose
gorillas actually
prefer the plants and you know the the
vegetation whatever
that's actually higher in protein intake
so throughout the year the diet is
usually between 17 up to 30 percent
protein that gives you about
350 to 600 grams of protein
and most of the time they actually
prefer the high end which is again
that would be 600 grams of protein
in one day for your average 400 plus
pound gorilla that's insane
that's that's more than one gram per
pound of body weight so where did that
myth come from that
you don't need a lot of protein because
look at gorillas they're juicy so don't
get it twisted gorillas get a lot of
protein in
and it's the same for other muscular
animals yes i went as far years ago and
studied
the most muscular animals you know lions
tigers horses and guess what
they also eat at least one gram per
pound of body when it comes to protein
next
let's look at the fat loss effects of
protein the direct
is began to i gotta hurry max video's
long as [ __ ] the direct effect is
obviously the carnitine
increasing your metabolism lowering your
appetite you know
and again the indirect effects is
through your hormones right but which
i'm sure
your growth hormone testosterone all
that stuff um helping you recover
which obviously is going to increase
your need and you eat because again when
you
you know not regard from the gym you
don't want to move you want to lay down
all day so
believe it or not that actually makes
you fatter because you're no longer in
the energy deficit
right people end up being in a surplus
when they don't recover well simply
because when you're not recovered well
you move less
right these are things that people don't
think about protein helps with that
right and the most powerful effect again
is on your metabolism the fact that
protein is such a high
[ __ ] thermic effect right your
appetite protein lowers your appetite
everyone knows this right keeps you full
longer
lowers growling right so why not have
the highest protein and say especially
if you're fat and struggle with
you know obesity and eating all day long
and things like that next
keeps your calories high while you're
cutting to me that's one of the
biggest benefits of a high protein diet
is you can cut on high as calories i
have my clients on
calories that would make you think wait
how are they losing weight with the
calories so damn high
because their protein is high as [ __ ]
right remember guys and i
made a read about that study right the
study about things about jose antonio
where uh they're fat people on the
surplus and they give them 800 extra
calories these were trained man
800 extra calories and based on the you
know
more calories are you going to get fat
no they actually lost fat
and retain lean mass so they put on more
lean mass even though they had
800 more calories and did not get fat at
all
and that's not just one isolated study
there are several studies on that look
that up guys most studies that where
people are over fat protein
even if they put on weight they put on
less fat than the other group
and they regain maintain or actually you
know put on more muscle
right that's why protein is the most
important macro for body composition
so many overfeeding studies have the
exact same conclusion so people when
you're actually cutting instead of
having your calories lower [ __ ] which
i'm always against
right because it [ __ ] up your
metabolism long term right having a high
ass protein intake
allows you to eat slightly more i mean
think about it when you can eat up to
800 more calories
and not get and not get fat at all
that's insane
but yet if you lower your your calories
too much to lower your protein too much
well guess what now you got to put up
with uh you know
lower t3 higher cortisol you know and
all that [ __ ]
thermic the fetal protein is about 20
meaning if you're eating a thousand
calories just from protein
your body is gonna burn roughly 200
calories just to process that that is
huge guys which is one of the reasons
why i would say
you can't just tell people the calories
are calorie because yes technically it
is
but the moment that goes inside your
body the waste process changes the game
and protein yes even though it has the
same calorie as one gram of carbs
right your body processes the protein
differently
so that's why it is better to be in a
surplus from protein and to being a
surplus from carbs or fats
right so just think about it 1 000
calories from protein your body is going
to burn about 200 calories just to
process that
do you know what 200 calories i've got
this is one [ __ ] hour on the
treadmill
you know how boring it is you just walk
on treadmill for one hour that's the
equivalent of 50 grams of carbs that's
like a bowl of pastel rice guys
cannot underestimate the power protein
liver you know health detox again that's
another thing i made a video on i'm not
going to go to the details look it up
your liver is your largest organ right
it weighs more than your brain
it's one of you in fact i don't want to
the most important object because you
obviously need your brain in your heart
but it's literally up there right and
it's also the most energy costly right
for a reason
it does way too many things and protein
is essential for keeping it healthy
later
right if you forgot the role of the
liver again it sends glucose to the
brain stores vitamins and minerals
that's why a lot of indigenous
populations like to like
eat the liver when they kill an animal
because it's a storehouse of vitamins
and minerals
it creates non-essential amino acids
helps you with digestion
put you know production hormones to
cholesterol
your immune system blah blah blah blah
blah the liver does so many [ __ ]
things then again watch my video on
liver and
liver detox and things like that and
guess what the number one source of fuel
for your liver is amino acids protein
next it's perfect for body composition
like i mentioned earlier maintaining
muscle losing fat
next non-essential amino acids because i
hate a lot of people say well you don't
need a lot of protein because
you know uh uh only a few are essential
the other ones are non-essential but
guess what
the majority of the non-essential amino
acids especially the important ones
are made from essential amino acids so
really i i hate the term non-essential
because how can something be
non-essential
if you need an essential amino acid to
[ __ ] make it but again again that's a
whole different topic right
example carnitine is made from lysine
which is essential taurine is made from
ethanol which is
essential made from phenylalanine
i spelled it wrong by the way you know
cysteine made from identity towers
like all of these things are made from
essential amino acids
next motivation dopamine guys
helps you with appetite control helps
you with motivation
right it's the main neural transmitter
involved
in you know keeping you motivated and
when your dopamine levels are low what
happens
you're demotivated you don't want to do
anything you you know you have low
energy because dopamine obviously
converts to adrenaline so
they'll you know they all play similar
roles right that's why most drugs
are dopamine agonists right cocaine
blackstreet absorption
of um dopamine that's why people that
take cocaine you know they can work for
longer hours they're full of energy
they're super motivated you know a lot
of not a lot of lawyers and
people in high finance abuse cocaine for
that very purpose
and of course i don't [ __ ] recommend
it i'm just letting you guys know the
mechanism of action
you know same thing meth you know
caffeine
all of these things increase dopamine
and give you this feeling of okay i'm
ready to conquer the world
guess what dopamine is made from [ __ ]
tyrosine
that's obviously made from phenylalanine
right so again it all comes back to
protein guys
protein is so [ __ ] essential
next digestion you cut and i always
emphasize digestion because
all of the food that you're eating means
absolute jack [ __ ] if your body cannot
digest and absorb it
right and guess what your gut is
sensitive to protein right in fact the
number one fuel for your gut is what
glutamine
and finally the 240 rule right that's
the one rule that i go over with my
clients all the time right
the body can only absorb well according
to mostly it's about 8 to 10 grams of
protein per hour
well what does that tell you that tells
you that if your body is absorbing
protein
every single hour which obviously you
know the body doesn't work like that but
if it did
theoretically speaking that's 240 grams
a day right 24 hours in a day
so that tells you that based on the
body's capacity to process and absorb
protein
higher protein intakes are actually
required
right because why would the body have
enough amino acid transporters and
things like that
to process up to 10 grams per hour if
it's not
ready to take in that amount right now
of course some of it is going to be
oxidized some of it is going to be used
for glucose and things like that but
that's besides the point
right so that's why believe it or not i
recommend
high-ass protein intakes of course you
know i tell them check with your doctor
make sure you have the kidney issues and
things like that
but because there are more rewards than
risks when it comes to eating protein
all right and to conclusion the benefits
of higher protein intake are endless
right gains and strength fat loss energy
mental
uh health appetite recovery bone density
digestion stress all these
all these things are just mentioned
vitamins and minerals removing toxins
and things like that
right so many benefits of a higher
protein diet and what are the risks
that are very [ __ ] small and i'm
always looking at race to reward ratio
right
every time i make a decision right
because that's the pit
that's literally the centerpiece of
trading you know whether you're trading
stocks you're trading
uh different instruments you always have
to focus on rewards so i use that same
mindset for training and everything else
look at the rewards of a high protein
diet and look at the risks right
kidney again that's only if you already
have kidney issues
right studies have been done on that if
your kidneys are fine you should be good
right and that's why i always tell
people hey check with your doctor check
with your doctor i'm not a [ __ ]
doctor
trouble your doctor as long as you as
long as he approves it you're good to go
right other breast cancer it's not
really risk but
it's expensive for [ __ ] right protein is
expensive right
but so is being a fat ass right so is
being out of shape next taste you know i
really don't like the taste of lean
meats right
because again if you have a high protein
diet you kind of want to you know keep
your fats low so you can make room for
your carbohydrates and your macros
and most people myself included i hate
the taste of lean meats
you know but again that's a small price
to pay and obviously your poops right if
you're not getting enough fiber and
water
high protein diet is going to destroy
you in the bathroom warning you right
now
right and of course like i said if
you're too skinny then you might want to
you know go on
i don't want to say low end but the
moderate moderate and of a protein
intake because you want to make room for
carbs right i
always say that when you're skinny
extremely skinny carbs
is actually more important right because
it's going to keep you hungry you're
going to keep eating you're going to get
your calories in
um and obviously it's gonna spare uh you
know a protein breakdown because again
the more the more carbs you eat the
higher your calories are
the less protein you need right and
actually the cancer risk but again guys
i don't even give i don't give a [ __ ] to
be honest because so many [ __ ] things
give you cancer
right right and and it's not it's not as
[ __ ] crazy as people make it out to
you everyone thinks oh if you eat i put
you
you know you're gonna have cancer like
the next day that's not how the body
works alright guys so
hopefully this video smashes all the
myths on protein that are out there
eat a high protein diet as long as your
doctor approves it as long as your
kidneys are fine
as long as you're not too broke and you
can actually afford it
there are way more benefits than rice
when it comes to eating high protein in
fact
most people most people are not eating
enough protein
simply based on all the factors that i
just mentioned right
and the recommendations vary like i said
you know every client i have has
different macros you know it depends on
so many things but
rarely do i put someone on less than 200
grams of protein
unless it's obviously a woman that's
obviously you know has a shorter stature
so the only people that actually have
eating less than 200 grams of protein
are women because again they have you
know their body mass is
significantly lower but if you're a dude
there's
no reason why you shouldn't be on at
least
at least one grams per pound of body
weight and that's at least
right now of course if you're super
super super obese i'm gonna have to make
some adjustments because again you gotta
factor in the fact that you're you know
your fat mass
um um it's not as metabolically active
as your muscle mass but
again that's for a whole separate video
for most people
you will benefit from a higher protein
intake

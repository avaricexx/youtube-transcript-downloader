this dish here
avocado turkey
bacon um baled eggs tuna some seasoning
not just in the gym with dominant in the
kitchen too team 3D dominance discipline
Direction follow me I'll show you how to
make this
some fresh avocados some tuna some eggs
some olive oil and vinegar little bit of
wrench be fresh when you eat some type
of seasoning some green onions one
tomato and you might need this [ __ ] to
mash the avocados up you want to boil
your
eggs you want to dice up your
onions want to dice up the tomatoes next
thing you going to do is you want to
empty the whole tray
here and you want to open up your tuna
cans and make sure you throw that nasty
water out that [ __ ] ass water next thing
you want to do is you want to spray this
[ __ ]
up after you got rid of all that [ __ ]
ass water you want to put this in your
Pan the next thing you want to do is you
want to put some seasoning up in this
bit so oh man it's not open
throw that onion powder on
here some garlic
powder now 2 minutes into this you might
want to put some olive oil into this
into the
mix that is something new I want to
throw into the
mix put some variety up in this [ __ ]
some cut a man it's [ __ ] fire some
sliced up turkey just three slices is
the turkey bacon I got to put the turkey
bacon in this man I love turkey
bacon spray up that pan you just
used throw in the
bacon [ __ ] all right next thing you want
to do is you want to come back to your
bowl but we have the avocado and the
green onions and the tomatoes chopped up
in pieces you want to mash it up
next thing you want to do is you want to
put some wrench in this and make sure
you don't go over floor cuz this wrench
even though it you know it tastes great
it has a lot of fat in there so put just
a tiny
bit some olive oil and
vinegar [ __ ] it just and also don't
forget to crack your eggs open and get
rid of the shell unless you [ __ ] eat
that [ __ ] if you eat the shell it's full
of protein I'm just [ __ ] now if you
notice by now and if you watch my other
videos you're going to notice I don't
throw away my egg yolks the egg yolks
have a lot of nutrients that are really
really important think about it this egg
becomes a [ __ ] chicken right chicken
is full of protein the yolk is the most
important part the yolk is really what
becomes you know the [ __ ] chicken so
the yolk has most of the nutrients I
know it has a lot of fat but guys it's
less fat than the amount of fat we
normally eat on a daily bases and also
if you know you're going to eat a lot of
egg yolks just make sure you balance it
out throughout the day make sure later
on you cut your fats as the day is go on
believe it or not the average
bodybuilder doesn't even eat the amount
of fat our body required and also new
discovery straight from Jimmy Str
Jackson Jimmy Str just announced to the
public eating eggshells actually
increases your testosterone level and
your growth hormone levels and keeps
your mushroom tip hard all night this
what the final products look like and
before you put them in a bowl you
actually want to cut them in small piece
cut your eggs up a little
bit throw them in
there thr them in here and mix it up
next if you want to grab that tuna that
we we you know actually fried earlier
it's a lot of [ __ ] protein and the
last step you want to grab the turkey
bacon from
earlier just put at the top now that's
the little that's a reward yourself guys
it's the icing on the cake team 3D style
get at me put some pepper on it next
step whole whe bread slice it up you'll
also need a zipl bag and a spoon
got bacon tuna
avocados eggs now if you're a greedy
[ __ ] you might actually want to
put it on both
slices all right next thing you want to
do is you want to obiously grab your
little
sandwich and make a whole bunch of these
[ __ ] make a whole bunch of them
and put them in zipl
bags and you can make like at least 10
or 20 of these put them in zipl bag put
them in the fridge and you have snacks
for days if you want to use it at night
obviously you don't want to use the
bread cuz you don't want to have a lot
of CBS at night so guys this is the
final result you have I mean avocados
you have green onions you have tomatoes
you have eggs you have um tuna you have
some you know turkey bacon so it's
Protein healthy fats you can't go wrong
and it's really really low on sugar so
this is a great D meal right there the
now the fat intake is kind of H but like
I said it's healthy fast and we all fast
in our d otherwise you ain't going to
have no [ __ ] testosterone now guys
normally you don't eat carbs at night so
I just made this for tomorrow but that's

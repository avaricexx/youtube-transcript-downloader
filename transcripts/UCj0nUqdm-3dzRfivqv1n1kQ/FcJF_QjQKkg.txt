hey guys going on megan here so let's
take a look at this study
it looked at the effect of vitamin d on
muscle strength and hypertrophy in a
group of
young and old men now the results were
all over the place but we'll go into
depth
long story short the young group is at
the top the old group is at the bottom
and let's focus on csa which pretty much
hypertrophy and as you can see
the white bar is the group that took
vitamin d keep in mind it did not take
enough vitamin d
it was actually a very very [ __ ] dose
but it was enough to see
bigger changes in hypertrophy compared
to the placebo group now it wasn't
statistically significant but as you can
clearly see it was enough
to raise an eyebrow as far as strength
only the other group noticed a
vast vast increase in the strength to
csa ratio which is pretty much how
efficient your body is at producing
force
so the young group put on a ton of gains
more than the placebo group and the old
group put on
a lot more strength and this is in spite
of the fact that they used a very very
[ __ ] dose
of vitamin d another benefit of vitamin
d supplementation was the fact that
the younger group had a greater increase
in type 2a muscle fibers long story
short those are the muscle fibers that
grow the most from training
and the most important part is the
change in myostatin as you can see here
the young group had a much bigger
much bigger drop in myostatin compared
to the placebo that did not take vitamin
d
by anyway this is another episode of my
style monday this video should be up
tomorrow
as soon as i find time to edit it and
make it shorter
guys my videos are always like [ __ ]
20 minute long and i have to cut it down
to 10 minutes or less
you guys have the shittiest attention
span ever but anyway this is another
episode of my step monday where we talk
about
everything related to myostatin which is
by far
the most important molecule if your goal
is to put on
ridiculous muscle size remember guys
three things determine how big
you'd get right your androgen receptor
content
the amount of satellite cells and nuclei
on your muscle
and your myostatin levels and out of
those three
myostatin is number one now for those
who already know what myostatin does you
can skip to the next chapter for the new
guys long story short
it's a gene that your body produces that
limits how big you can get
so what it does is it lowers protein
synthesis it increases protein breakdown
so it [ __ ] up your gains
it lowers satellite cell activation and
it makes you insulin resistant which
pretty much makes you fat over time
now phylostatin is the opposite of
myostatin it's the
protein that your body makes to
counteract the effects of myostatin so
it's the most anabolic molecule in the
body it's even more anabolic than
testosterone
so long story short matched and bad fast
and good
as you can see here the reason why
cancer patients and hiv patients
lose muscle so rapidly is because
myostatin goes up under those conditions
same reason why when astronauts go in
space they lose a ton of muscle mass
myostatin goes up
same reason why when you immobilize your
leg or you put a lame on the cast the
reason why it shrinks and loses so much
size is because once again myostatin
goes up
by the way cortisol is the main up
regulator myostatin and for those who
haven't seen this before this is an
example of how powerful
the falstein and marstein pathway is the
rat
above is the normal rat the one below
has been genetically engineered to
overproduce phylostatin
and to lack myostatin completely so you
can see it has four times
the muscle mass that is the biggest
change in muscle growth that we've seen
in the entire literature right so best
case scenario is having
my stand as low as possible and faster
and as high as possible
here's another picture where you can see
the leg difference night and day
and there goes the actual rats before
they were killed unbelievable
same age same everything only difference
is
myostatin and palestine keep in mind no
testosterone no steroids nothing
just to show you how powerful that
pathway is
and this is the famous monkey that was
injected with phylostatin in his leg
and just a few weeks later look at how
much muscle size
his legs gained and this is the video
the 10 year old kid in asia who has a
myostatin deficiency he completely lacks
the myostatin gene so his muscles are
pretty much allowed to grow
what i restrained as you can see at 10
years old he's
way more developed than the average 10
year old which is right next to him
and he looks like he's on steroids even
though he's on absolutely nothing
look at his back and leg musculature
even his neck and traps
unbelievable just to show you what can
be achieved
with this pathway alone remember
professional bodybuilders and
people in the juice have to take at
least three to six compounds sometimes
even more
just to look anywhere close to that and
he looks like this naturally
so once again it's all about the mystery
file style pathway
even ifbb bodybuilders the reason why
they look so cartoonish is so
huge is mainly because every single
steroid
every single pd that increases muscle
mass pretty much
interferes with the myostatin pathway
right so even if myostatin goes up
they usually increase phylostatin or
find ways to inhibit this activity
through rgf1 or other pathways
and even as a natural trainee study
after study after study after study have
confirmed that the most
important thing you should worry about
when you step foot in the gym
is how can you down regulate the
myostatin gene
right the more efficient you are at down
regulating it the more muscle i'm
actually going to put on so don't think
just because you're going to the gym
you're low in my statin it doesn't work
like that and you have to do enough
volume you have to do enough frequency
and you obviously have to train with
enough effort right not everyone who
goes in the gym
lowers my style which is why not
everyone who goes to the gym puts on
muscle
you might put on strength but in order
to increase muscle mass
you have to down regulate my style but
anyway watch my previous videos i went
over all these different studies
so now you finally see why everything
that blocks my stat and to a great
extent
is banned by the world into doping
agency all right so back to the study
young group
other groups so let's look at the top
quadriceps csa cross-sectional area
that's pretty much gains
um the group that took vitamin d which
is the white bar as you can see
more gains than the placebo group now
once again it wasn't statistically
significant
but it was significant enough to show an
effect
right and the reason why it wasn't
statistically significant because once
again they only
took about 1900 ius right that is a
[ __ ] dose you need
way more than that to realize the full
effects of vitamin d
right the average person needs at least
five to ten thousand iu especially for
your body but if you lift weights you
need at least five to ten thousand hours
a day
right because we're not getting enough
sunlight remember guys vitamin d is
produced from your skin
when it comes to contact with sunlight
most of us don't spend enough time
outdoors
for our skin to synthesize enough
vitamin d and most of us don't eat
enough fish to get into our diets
so over 90 of people who live in the
modern world are vitamin d deficiency
which is ridiculous because it is one of
the most important hormones in the body
remember it's not a vitamin it's a
hormone it was called a vitamin by
accident
if you watch my video on sunlight it's
called sunglasses anabolic something
like that i go over all the details of
vitamin it has a ton of effects on
muscle growth
fat loss your mood and energy levels
your health
right it is not optional the reason why
you don't hear it mentioned enough is
because
there's no way to monetize it right big
corporations can't really monetize
the beneficial effects of sunlight right
you can't pat in the sun right
vitamin d is cheap so they don't talk
about it enough and you guys know i'm
all about the basics
focus on the basics right get your
sunlight if you can't get enough
sunlight for whatever reason
get it through vitamin d supplementation
but you are missing out on all these
benefits
if you're not getting enough sunlight or
if you're not getting enough vitamin d
remember we evolved to be hunters and
gatherers we evolved
out in the wild we were not designed to
be indoors all day right so that's why
we have all these issues today
i mean look at all the things that
vitamin d plays a role in cancer
prevention health disease prevention
blood pressure diabetes obesity notice
how these are all the issues of the
modern world
and sure enough if you look at the
vitamin d levels of people who live in
the modern world
our vitamin d levels are trash right
most of us are below 30 nanograms per
milliliter
you need to be at least above 40 to reap
all the benefits
right and people are around 20 if you
have darker skin if you have [ __ ] skin
like myself you [ __ ] right you're even
worse because remember guys this dudes
when we have black people and white
people is because of vitamin d
right all the people who live next to
equator but there's plenty of sunlight
we have a lot of melanin that protects
us from sunlight but the downside is
that lowers the amount of vitamin d our
bodies can make so we have to be in the
sun a lot longer
in order to synthesize the required
amount of vitamin d
meanwhile the people who left africa and
went into the northern latitudes where
there's not enough uvb
rays they had to develop lighter skin in
order to better absorb
the uvb rays right the ones who went to
the north
and didn't have uh you know a mutation
that allowed them to have lighter skin
or whatever
died out right because there's no way if
you have a ton of melanin and you go in
the north where there's not enough sun
you [ __ ] right
because now you're not absorbing calcium
bone density sucks your muscle mass
suffers your health suffers your immune
system suffers
right and you eventually die out that's
why you're not gonna find a single a
single hunter gatherer tribe
even back in the old days uh with dark
skinned in the north right unless they
obviously had access to like you know
fish and stuff like that
so they can make up for the lack of
vitamin d synthesis right so let's
assure the average white person
right because they don't have melanin
they can produce enough vitamin d
in five to ten minutes of sunlight the
average darker skinned person needs at
least
depending on how dark you are at least
one or two hours and how many people are
getting that
right so don't neglect the basics right
look at the effect
of just a [ __ ] dose of vitamin d on
muscle size right and for the old group
that's strength went through the roof
and if you look at fiber type look
they had a significant increase in type
2a fibers fast food fibers
once again thanks to vitamin d and if
you look at my style and expression
forget about the spot that's just the
vitamin d receptor and that's the enzyme
that
activates vitamin d and converts it to
its active form but anyway if you look
at my statin
once again the group that took vitamin d
had a bigger reduction
in myosin which explains the favorable
changes in muscle morphology see who
would have thought
sunlight indirectly lowers myosin
because remember we were designed to get
our vitamin d from the sun right there
was no vitamin d supplements back in the
hunter-gathered days right
and fish was not always abundant
depending on where your ancestors lived
so our bodies are like batteries we like
superman really we get charged from the
sun
so conclusion yes sunlight indirectly
again through vitamin d
lowers myostatin and helps you maximize
your results from the gym
in younger people you can expect an
increase in fat storage fibers
and a slight increase in muscle mass 11
compared to 7 for the placebo group and
in old people you can expect a
ridiculous
increase in strength but keep in mind
these were at the low doses right
the study should have been done with
much much higher doses anyway to say
guys if you need more information on
vitamin d
sunlight and how it affects your gains

called

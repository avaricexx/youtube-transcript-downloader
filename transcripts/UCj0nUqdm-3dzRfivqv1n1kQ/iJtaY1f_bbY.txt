hey guys going on megan here another
episode of top tip tuesday
this one is going to give me so much
trouble but you guys know i got to stay
objective
and i got to talk about the topics i
enjoy so anyway today we're going to
rank the top 10 ethnic groups races
population whatever you want to call it
based on height last time we did we did
hypertrophy right we did a
muscle building potential and i think we
did strength potential
and now we're doing height now oh my
goodness this is the frustrating part
there goes the disclaimer i'm gonna try
to keep it short this time because it's
so draining
guys don't even watch this video if
you're gonna be offended right if you're
a new subscriber i'm one of you right
now if you're sensitive do not watch
because you will cry right i'm objective
i don't get from referring to people in
my ethnic groups or other other groups
i'm always gonna mention the pros and
the cons are good and the bad right so
if you're sensitive don't even watch
don't even waste your time i was gonna
say dislike and get lost but you guys
know what youtube did with the dislike
ball but anyway let's get two quick
disclaimers out the way number one when
i say race
guys i'm referring i'm using a quick way
to categorize people right it's easier
to say black white asian than to say oh
the group of people who are you know
north latitude abc blah blah blah with
haplogroup y and haplotype i don't have
time for that [ __ ] right if i told you
that somebody just robbed me and he's
asian are you going to look for this guy
or you're going to look for somebody who
looks like this if i say oh somebody
just
kicked me in my chest and he's black are
you going to look for this guy or this
guy right so it's just a quick way to
categorize people so stop it with your
politics nobody's racist here i don't
believe anybody is superior to another
person
just based on what ethnic group or race
they're in right it's all relative
everything is relative
we are different we are good at
different things and we don't do so well
in other things depending on our
genetics and uh and not ethnic groups
and of course there are outliers there
are outliers in every group right there
are tall and jack south asians there are
fast asians the
[ __ ] athletic
whites and you name it right every group
has its own outliers so when i'm making
these videos i'm just going fast i'm
generalizing right to make the videos
shorter right when we say west africans
are fast that does not mean every west
african descendant is fast
it means there's a higher proportion of
fast athletes within their population
when we say asians are smart that
doesn't mean every [ __ ] asian is
smart and every black person whatever is
dumb no it just means there's a higher
concentration of high q individuals in
the asian population and that's facts i
know it hurts your feelings i know it
goes against what you were taught but as
facts right
there are outliers in every group just
stop getting butt hurt right if i say
smoking is bad there's always this one
idiot that's gonna say well my uncle
smokes and he lives to 94. [ __ ] you and
your uncle all right i'm talking about
in general all right let's get started
and also
man you guys are saying people are
getting offended because of what i'm
using here right the tier system guys i
use that for everything i'm about to not
all the way down to pure garbage i use
that when i'm ranking foods uh athletes
[ __ ] training programs exercises you
name it right so this is not specific to
this video this is just my general
template all right now that we got this
painful disclaimer out of the way let's
get started hi keep in mind guys what
determines your height is mainly
genetics and nutrition right
specifically the amount of good quality
animal protein your parents fed you as a
kid right so if your parents fed you a
bunch of [ __ ]
and put you on some vegan bs right
unless they were able to get all the
missing amino acids chances are you're
probably going to be short right again
unless your genetics over composite okay
so please no superiority complex here i
don't see anybody bragging in the
comment section or no one crying right
your heart is determined by your
genetics and your early childhood
nutrition
okay so let's start with middle east you
guys are in a okay category right and i
had to cap how to cap the uh
the groups at 10 because there's too
many right there's way too many ethnic
groups way too many even within the
the the three major or four or five
major races whatever it is too many
ethnic groups so i had to cap it at 10.
so people from the middle east you guys
in okay category you want to thank
people from iran and iraq because if you
were just going off to people from you
know saudi arabia and further south you
guys would have been a lot lower but
anyway so middle east north africa
whatever as a whole on average you guys
are in the okay category right and okay
it's roughly you know five eight and
below so on average i know there are
variations i know there are ethnic
groups within this group who are taller
and are some who are shorter but on
average
you guys are in an okay category
five eight and below next aboriginals
you guys are in a bad category yeah i'm
sorry but it's facts
right on average there are way too many
of you [ __ ] who are shorter
than five or eight i don't worry i'm
sure too so i know how you guys feel
next asians that's an easy one you guys
are also in a bad category
way too many of you [ __ ] are
five seven and below
now
keep in mind it's getting better right
asians are actually getting taller
decade after decade right obviously due
to better nutrition and things like that
which goes back to what i said earlier
it's not all genetics right it's also
environment and nutrition and china is
the proof you know a lot of east asians
not just china also south korea japan
whatever a lot of these guys are getting
taller because you know nutrition has
improved especially high quality protein
but again uh relative to all the other
groups
bad category next east africans believe
it or not
believe it or not you guys are down here
too man you know east east africans got
some short [ __ ] yes of course
there's always the outliers right for
example the night loads the the thinker
tribe to be specific
these are the tallest people in the
[ __ ] world but
they're a very very very small
percentage of the entire east african
population so it's not enough effect
it's because of those [ __ ] you
guys are not a pure garbage right it's
because of the extremely tall
um
people from the now region and things
like that
that you guys up here but if it wasn't
for these [ __ ] the average is a
lot lower right five six and below
in many regions native americans right
so for my hispanic guys out there
depending on
uh i'm gonna mention mixed races later
but you know i always get asked where
are the hispanics what are the hispanics
guys you guys are mixed man but i'm
gonna miss your mix later on you guys
are native american
right whether it's enough north america
or south america mix with europeans and
obviously makes with a little bit of
west africa
but here i'm talking about native
americans you know as as pure as
possible so the ones who are not too
mixed you guys are also in a bad
category in fact you would have been a
lot higher because uh the north
americans right the native north
americans were actually tall you know
they were actually in the okay category
but the south native americans you know
what i'm talking about my people from
peru and colombia believe it you guys
are short as [ __ ] right so again on
average
god i gotta keep repeating that because
i know somebody's gonna type my
grandfather is above 10.
but anyway yeah so on average you guys
are down here right so really start so
you guys really got to start feeding
your kids better so that you can
maximize your height genetics now i know
there are other factors involved such as
pollution and health and all these other
things but again i don't want to go off
to engine
all right next next next polynesians
these guys are in a [ __ ] amazing
category right and i already made a
video about these behemoths so you guys
could check it out but mainly because of
the people from samoa and tunga and
things like that these guys are tall
giants
[ __ ] amazing but because of the the
the other ethnic groups that are within
the polynesian and melanesian population
this brings you guys down from i'm about
to not too [ __ ] amazing right because
you do have some short [ __ ] in
some of the ethnic groups the sub ethnic
growths within the polynesian and
melanesian um population next oh man you
guys are gonna hate me man but
don't blame me blame natural selection
blame your
your traditions and diets and whatever
but my south asian brothers
god damn
you guys are down here man
i mean the average height and you know
again when i say south asia i'm grouping
again the entire south asian population
so that's india that's malaysia that's i
mean it's indonesia all the people down
there right
you guys are the shortest people oh i
should say the shortest group right
because you guys are not the the
shortest
um ethnicity right you guys are not the
shortest ethnic group on the planet the
pygmies took that from y'all but as a
whole you know the south asian
population
you guys are down here man you guys are
sure and like i said it's mainly again
protein
um there's a lot of you know vegetarian
or vegan whatever you know because the
hinduism
stuff going on so that affected your
genetics right genetic changes
epigenetic changes
um but like i said this is nothing that
can't be fixed just like china and a lot
of east asian countries were able to
increase their height
you guys can do the same right you got
to eat your protein man protein is not
just for building muscle
um and of course like i said there are
different factors involved i'm going to
explain in further videos but
yeah you guys are down here man
don't shoot the messenger now of course
the further north you go right north
india and you know because not now
you're getting close to the middle east
and stuff like that especially if you go
northwest yet of course the height
starts to increase but
overall
uh very very very short all right um and
like i said it's mainly because of
indonesia malaysia
um cambodia you know all those people
really brought the average down indians
overall actually uh a bit taller than
the people i just mentioned all right um
plus
this one is also going to get me
crucified but once again this is team 3d
alpha we gotta stay objective
europeans white people whatever you want
to call them i'm about to not category
you guys are the tallest [ __ ]
in the world as a group right as a group
of course there are some short europeans
but as a group
you guys are tall
than a [ __ ] especially the
[ __ ] scandinavians especially the
scandinavians you don't believe me
travel to northern europe
travel to some
regions in central europe travel to the
balkans you're going to see some giants
just walking around and as i explained
before genetics and nutrition it's no
coincidence that over 95 of the top 20
tallest countries in the world
are all
in europe but anyway so
man man man there goes
where i fall in west africans
west africans and their descendants of
course we are in the pure garbage
category man i'm sorry we are short as
[ __ ]
right and this is not keep in mind we
would have been a lot higher if i would
have been lower if it wasn't for
um african-americans right but then
again african-americans are mixed you
know you know 70 to 75 percent uh west
african and about 20 to 25 european
right so african-americans are depending
on how makes you or how pure you are
whatever you you're going to be a mixed
group but us west african so that's
nigerians that's ivory coast that's
banana whatever
we are but obviously we are a bit taller
than um south asians but we are short
man we are short as [ __ ] and of course
it's because again the nutrition aspect
and also the genetic aspect which i'm
going to mention in a minute um but uh
yeah we we're down here so i'm down here
right i'm 5'8 so i got lucky uh but it's
still really [ __ ] short because me
being five eight i'm actually tall in
some regions in africa which is
embarrassing right
tall should be five nine five ten you
know we are so short in west africa that
a guy who's five eight is considered
tall and what really brought the average
down is oh come on my pygmy brothers you
guys [ __ ] us man because remember guys
obviously i've picked me's in in asia as
well um but but usually when i'm
referring to payments i'm referring to
the payments in the congo region cameron
region whatever the shortest people in
the entire world right i think the
average male is only five feet tall
right so you guys [ __ ] us my pygmy
brothers show love so love right um
african americans are actually tall
which i mean i'm going to mention soon
uh you african americans decide to make
a separate category just for
african-americans again it depends on
you know how mixed there are with
um europeans and stuff like that but
they're usually in the okay to [ __ ]
amazing category right because the
average height for african americans is
five nine which is above the okay
category should either be somewhere here
to the left or up here but like i said
it depends on the heritage and i know a
lot of people are going to get hurt
because you guys probably thought that
asians were shorter than west africans
and ah times have changed you know
asians are getting taller you know
asians are getting taller and so over
but west africa come on we could do
better guys we could do better right we
got to improve that nutrition
right we got to get all these corrupt
politicians out of office but anyway let
me stay focused mix races right so makes
ethnic groups whatever you wanna call it
so that's hispanics latinos again
african-americans depending on how mechs
there are you know if you're a mix then
i can't again it depends on how makes
you it depends on what you mix with
right so i'm gonna put you in okay for
now but it depends right if you mix
[ __ ]
uh west african and uh
uh european then again you might be
somewhere in here somewhere in the
middle or maybe you know slightly taller
if you mix [ __ ]
uh west african and [ __ ] pygmy and
[ __ ]
uh south asian then you'll be low down
here right so it depends on you know
what you mix with right so don't just
say hey i'm makes what do you think my
genetics are like uh first of all
nobody can tell you genetics alike you
know we're just going based off broad
observations and broad statistics and
data collected on
uh you know a raw population so you
gotta test your own genetics but
it depends on what you mix with right if
you just want to estimate
if you don't want to get tested you just
want to estimate look at your parents by
the way that's it guys there goes the
tallest ethnic groups racist blah blah
blah in the world from i'm about to
non-category pure garbage
you got the europeans you lucky sons of
[ __ ] you got [ __ ] amazing you got
the polynesians mainly the samoans and
people from tonga and stuff like that
you have okay so that's middle east and
it makes races depending on what you're
mixed with
you have bad right so that's
aboriginal
east asian east african
native american which you know could be
higher
but because of overwhelming uh uh south
american population you guys are down
here and you got pure garbage which is
us west africans i'm looking at you guys
pygmies and nigerians you got west
africans yep that's where i you got west
africans yep we short as [ __ ] and you
have south asians mainly indonesia
poland um
not poland asia uh indonesia malaysia
uh vietnam thailand you know that whole
region and some parts of india but

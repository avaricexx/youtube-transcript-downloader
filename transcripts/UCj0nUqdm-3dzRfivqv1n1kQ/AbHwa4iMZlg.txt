hey guys going on megan here the
sunlight
video is finally out can the sun get you
jacked
all right so problem up to 90 of people
don't get enough sun
why is that an issue well the sun is one
of the top five most anabolic things
up there with sleep water protein and
healthy fats
so whenever you guys hear me say manage
recovery well you're about to find out
why i always include
sunlight and i guarantee you after this
video you might end up spending a lot
more time outside
but anyway bodybuilder of the day is
berto fox
very controversial bodybuilder due to
his criminal past in fact he's serving
time
in prison right now but we're not going
to get into the details we keeping this
strictly
bodybuilding based as you all know the
bodybuilder today has nothing to do with
their videos it's
purely for entertainment anyway height 5
8 weight 245 pounds gives him an arm
ratio of about 42 which was pretty drag
and his best body part was his biceps
and his chest
the power of the sun right so first the
sun has direct effects on your ability
to build muscle
and obviously later on in the video i'm
going to explain the mechanism behind it
you know the conversion
of vitamin d and all that stuff but
pretty much has a huge effect on your
ability to build muscle it has strong
effects on your ability to burn fat
it has powerful effects on your brain so
you depress you know depression
motivation and obviously it has
massive massive effects on your health
and all of these things are proven guys
how does the sun directly affect your
strength well
one it affects your fastest fibers right
it increases the size of your fastest
fibers
and the amount of faster fibers that you
have uh it's been proven to improve your
performance your recovery your glycogen
synthesis which is obviously going to
fuel your workouts
um mainly through insulin sensitivity
and obviously your hormone which we're
going to talk about in a minute
and also a fun fact about performance
studies have been done on athletes and
they found out that the performance of
athletes
usually peaks right around the time when
the amount of sunlight the amount of
optimal sunlight that we get also peaks
right so not only it's very correlated
with the vitamin d levels in the blood
but also with the season right so
obviously you guys know you get
maximum benefits of sunlight around the
summer
and then you get the lowest amount of
sunlight um
around winter time and that's exactly
the pattern
that athletic performance follows next
sunlight and myostatin unless you've
been living under a rock
you should know by now that myostatin is
one of the most important regulators of
muscle mass
in short the more my stand you have the
harder it is for you to build muscle and
the less my stand you have
the more muscle you're building as you
can see in these different pictures here
this was the baby that had a mass stand
efficiency and you could as you can tell
this guy is jacked out of his mind look
at his calves uh same thing with the you
know belgian blue cows you got the mice
you got the myostatin deficient dogs so
in short
myostatin is one of the most important
things to look at when we talk about
muscle growth
and obviously sunlight has a profound
effect
on my stand concentrations also keep in
mind guys when you train your my style
levels go down temporarily which is what
allows you to build muscle from training
but obviously that's very short-lived
right the reduction you get in my style
from training
goes away after about 24 hours and of
course anything that increases
testosterone or igf-1
is automatically going to lower your
myostatin and anything that increases
your stress hormone cortisol is going to
increase your mindset
sunlight and satellite cells if you
watch my videos you know i'm huge on
cellular cells that's what nuclear solar
is all about
the more satellite cells and nuclei you
have obviously the more muscle you can
put on
and sunlight has an effect on not just
your myostatin concentrations which we
just talked about that also influences
your satellite selectivity
but on igf-1 which is one of your master
regulators of satellite cells
and obviously testosterone right again
which well with people on steroids that
have
huge increases in satellite cell and
nuclei content
next sunlight and hormones again
testosterone you cannot avoid
testosterone when you're talking about
muscle growth right the most anabolic
hormone in the body
sunlight has profound effects on your
testosterone levels especially if you're
deficient
and quick refresher the body produces
about three to ten milligrams of
testosterone a day so the average person
will produced about seven milligrams a
day
which comes out to about 50 right 49 to
50 milligrams a week
so if you have shitty genetics or you're
obese or whatever so you on this
and on the ranger you're producing about
three milligrams a day
average person will probably make again
seven if you're lucky you have good
genetics so
you know good lifestyle factors and
stuff like that you're probably pumping
out 10 milligrams a day
which is going to come out to about 70
milligrams a week a person on trt is
making almost double that right 50
to double that amount right because
they're getting let's say
150 200 milligrams uh
of testosterone a week if you remove the
ester weight that still comes out to a
significant amount of testosterone
uh per day you know at least about 15
milligrams someone
even getting 20. and obviously people
down steroids on huge
doses of steroids you know like ibb pros
they're getting
way more than that right they're getting
anywhere from 50 to 60 sometimes even 70
milligrams
of testosterone a day even if you remove
the ester weight and of course
if you want super high doses of
testosterone based on the study that i
mentioned over and over again
look at the effects 600 milligrams of
testosterone for 10 weeks the group that
did not train
put on 20 pounds on that bench press
from not
training so that bench press went about
20 pounds from not training at all
not only they put on the mask they added
20 pounds to that bench press
and the natty group right so natty plush
training
put on about the same amount so super
high doses of testosterone no don't
worry you're not going to get that from
sunlight but
super high doses of testosterone from
steroids obviously gives you
just as much strength in 10 weeks as a
person who's
going to the gym full 90 training now
the nadi group they put on
more gains in their squats but still you
know these stats are amazing just to
show you that
testosterone is no joke and don't let
nobody tell you that oh it's just water
weight it's not real muscle knows
a lot of follow-up studies were done and
have found that yes
the gains that you put on from
testosterone are mainly lean muscle mass
they looked at protein synthesis
myofibril protein synthesis
they looked at the different fibers type
two type one
and they've all concluded the same thing
further proof of that is the fact that
steroids themselves
were invented for people who were
bedridden you know people that were in
icu intensive care unit people who were
wasting away from cancer
aids hiv steroids were invented for
those people they were not invented for
bodybuilders right
so if testosterone didn't increase your
lean muscle mass they wouldn't give it
to icu patients right they don't go up
to a person who's
burning away and wasting away and say
hey let's increase your water weight of
course not right
so as a natty keep prioritizing
testosterone levels
now there's an interesting study i call
it a ball study
it was back in the 1930s uh dr abraham
something where
they exposed men's testicles to sunlight
and they reported huge increases in
testosterone i think
the ones that expose their chest got
like a hundred percent hundred and
twenty percent increase in testosterone
and the ones who have the sunlight
beaming down on their balls
got way more than that i forgot the
exact amount but the thing about the
study again it was done back in 1930s
and the thing about the study though is
that there's not a lot of follow-up
studies on that right i don't like
quoting random you know
single studies i like seeing uh you know
meta-analysis or several different
variations of the same study so
hopefully they do more of these studies
i believe right personally i believe
that it's true
right um but again i don't want to go
off my beliefs
i want to see the facts so hopefully
they do a lot more of these studies in
the near future because i actually want
to see like is this true because
i don't mind i would go out balls
dangling
if that's true but until we see further
studies on that you know i can't really
tell you guys to go
with your balls hanging out if you want
to try it fine but um
i personally think that it might work
but anyway uh sunlight also has effects
on your insulin sensitivity
your leptin and your rgf1 as already
mentioned
next sunlight and energy levels so
sunlight
has proven to improve your dopamine
levels as you guys know
the woman is responsible for your
motivation your willpower so if you're
dieting or you're just trying to you
know
he's trying to stick to a diet or
training program your dopamine levels
are paramount right also keep in mind
dopamine converse to adrenaline so if
you have low dopamine
chances are you're going to have low
energy levels remember adrenaline is
your most powerful fat burner
sunlight has been proven to improve
serotonin right and the thing is
everyone knows this one you don't even
need a study to prove that because
everyone just feels better um around the
summertime and most of the depression
most people are just depressed as [ __ ]
in the winter time now of course
coalition is not causation there are
other things in play
but we have seen the research has shown
direct effects of sunlight you know
obviously vitamin d
on on your mood again you have a lot of
vitamin d receptors
in all these regions of the brain that
are associated with mood depression
uh confidence all these things so
sunlight does affect your mood does
affect your confidence
um but obviously by increasing your
testosterone it increases your red blood
cells which is going to obviously
increase your energy
why is that important well you can't
make gains if you feel like [ __ ] all the
time right
next sunlight and muscle growth
increases your protein synthesis through
mtor
uh your hydrophone levels testosterone
fast rush muscles
uh your insulin sensitivity that's gonna
help not just with carb but obviously
protein people forget that insulin also
helps the absorption of amino acids so
if you're getting a lot of protein but
you're insulin resistant you're not
making full use of that
uh lowest protein breakdown through
managing my statin and cortisol and
obviously increases your performance
through
as mentioned earlier increasing your
strength your willpower your energy
and your ability to recover yes sunlight
does affect
your ability to recover from workouts oh
and back to the fastest most apart it's
so similar coincidence that
the tribes and population groups that
have the highest concentration of phase
muscles which are mainly
west africans um also around the
part of the equator that gets the
strongest
best concentration of uvb rays but i'm
gonna go into more detail when i make my
video on genetics and why
west africans and jamaicans and
descendants of west africans which are
african americans
have so much more fast switched muscles
than every other group on the planet
stay tuned for that video next sunlight
and fat loss yes again
it's gonna help you with fat loss or
improving your insulin sensitivity
right uh which is obviously going to
lower your symptoms of type 2 diabetes
it's going to lower inflammation and
obviously your hormonal adaptations
which as i mentioned earlier
testosterone is one of the most powerful
uh fat antagonists everyone thinks
assassins just muscle muscle muscle
testosterone is also especially in the
natural range one of the most powerful
uh anti-fat hormones and also just
trying to get more sunlight is gonna
indirectly make you burn fat because
you're gonna go out in the sun right
going down the sun
is gonna have you move around more walk
around more maybe do more cardio
so that's going to directly uh increase
your knee right your non
exercise activity thermogenesis when
you're indoors all day trust me you're
not burning
[ __ ] right sitting on a chair or landing
bad playing video games
you're not burning a lot of calories
meanwhile going outside even if it's
just for a walk
walking your dog playing soccer
basketball whatever
that's gonna increase your ability to
burn fat because you're just gonna
automatically burn more calories
and obviously sunlight and health the
effects of sunlight and health are
monstrous guys tons and tons and tons
and tons and tons of studies back this
up
effects on cancer i mean breast cancer
colon cancer prostate cancer renal
cancer
uh in fact because black people have one
of the lowest concentrations of vitamin
d
um it's also linked to the fact that we
have
the highest rates of prostate cancer out
of all population groups
now there's a lot of debate you know
some studies saying hey well
black people do have lower vitamin d but
they have
less of the binding protein some are
saying no this was an error they
actually
you know they have less of the binding
protein but the affinity is higher blah
blah blah going back and forth but one
thing that we know for a fact is that
black people especially
um outside of their quote-unquote
natural habitat so outside of the
uh you know countries that are close to
the equator have
very very low vitamin d levels and they
also have
all the symptoms and diseases associated
with low vitamin d except the bone issue
because the body finds ways to
overcompensate for the lack of vitamin d
for example
if you have low vitamin d it'll try to
increase your parathyroid hormone
um things like that or increase the
affinity of the binding protein or
lower your body protein but your body
can only overcompensate for so long
eventually
things start to break down so anyway so
sun has been shown to reduce
cancer heart disease blood pressure
diabetes both type 1 and type 2
obesity leptin resistance all the bone
diseases and mass
depression autoimmune diseases
inflammation
flu cold blah blah blah you name it and
now with the whole coronavirus [ __ ]
people are getting even less vitamin d
right because you know everyone's
staying indoors
and not going out as much so the
benefits of sunlight uh
are endless and that's why ancient
civilizations used to worship the sun
you know the source of life you know the
egyptians the aztecs the romans the
greeks
you name it you know almost every major
civilization
uh knew knew the powerful effects of
sunlight and now we finally have studies
that actually show that holy [ __ ] you
know this is happening on the chemical
level
but anyway how does this whole thing
work right how it works one start off
with the sun right
so you have the uvb rays right you guys
know this uva uvb whatever
so uvb rays usually around 10 to 2 pm
that's when they're the strongest
you also have to be around the right
latitude right anything below 37 is
ideal
and they come in contact with your skin
and they convert 70 hydrogen cholesterol
which is just a precursor of cholesterol
into vitamin d3 right using your skin so
your skin
converts cholesterol into vitamin d3
using sunlight that's why vitamin d is
not really a vitamin it's actually a
hormone it's a steroid hormone reason
why was called the vitamin is because
again it was default
cold and cold vitamin discovered so
that's why it's called vitamin d vitamin
a b
c d um but eventually we find out a holy
[ __ ] this thing is actually a hormone
your body makes it
now here's the thing if you white if you
have pale skin
uh it only takes about 15 minutes to get
a huge
uh dose of vitamin d from the sun right
about 10 or 20 000 iu's
if you're dark it'll take you six to
eight times
more exposure more sun in order to get
that same amount right because remember
that's one of the main reasons if not
the only reason why
uh there's different skin colors skin
different skin pigmentations you know
if you go further north you're not gonna
find
in fact you're gonna find zero
indigenous black
tribes far above the equator that's not
gonna happen
because white skin evolved to be able to
absorb
vitamin d better and also if you go
too far below the equator and if you go
too far below the 3740 parallel right
close to the equator
you're not going to find a lot of you
know white tribes keep in mind i'm
talking about back in the days not now
where everybody's traveling you know
planes and
boats and [ __ ] but you know i'm
referring to thousands and thousands of
years ago
so why is that right remember the darker
your skin
the less sunlight you can absorb due to
melanin that's that's what melanin does
melanin is a natural sunscreen right so
if you have dark skin
you have a lot of melanin and that
melanin protects you from the sun that's
why black people don't use sunscreen you
know i
i don't even know what the [ __ ]
sunscreen was until i got older and i
was like what the [ __ ] like people
actually use this [ __ ] you know
believe it or not growing up in west
africa i had no clue that white people
had
had to use sunscreen right so black
people have melanin and that protects
them from the sun the downside of that
is
it also lowers the amount of vitamin d
we get from the sun so we have to spend
more time outside
in order to get the same amount whereas
white people can just be outside for 15
minutes
sometimes 30 minutes and boom they have
enough vitamin d
um to last them for a good while that's
that's also why
black people outside of africa or in the
modern world
have so many issues that are linked to
low vitamin ds because we're not we're
no longer in quote unquote our natural
habitat you know we're no longer getting
um that equation not only we have
melanin but now you have air
conditioners keeping people indoors
you have clothes right people have long
sleeve uh
long-sleeve clothes pants all that stuff
so
it's creating a lot a lot a lot of
health issues
but anyway you can also get vitamin d3
from your diet
but you're not gonna get as much as from
the sun that's why i keep saying
sunlight
as opposed to just vitamin d because you
could get vitamin d from your diet if
you get it from fish for example fish
uh you need about depending on what kind
of fish right depending if it's salmon
or tuna if it's a farm raise a wild card
you're going to get different amounts of
vitamin d right but even the the highest
amount you know it's usually about
you know 100 iu pounds you're going to
have to eat about 50 ounces of fish
of salmon you know again depending on
what kind of fish just to get 5 000 ius
that's not happening right
that's just not realistic you can try to
use cod level oil right two ounces will
give you about
close to six thousand iu but people stop
taking car level oil
or you could just supplement you can
take the pail vitamin d3
uh it comes in uh the pairs are usually
five thousand ius some are ten thousand
iu
uh they're very cheap right but as
always
getting it from the sun is always the
best source in fact
the vitamin d you get from your diet is
not as stable as the one that your body
actually makes which
i mean which obviously makes sense right
we do not evolve to get vitamin d
outside of sunlight like again you're
not going to find 50 ounces of fish
on a daily basis and i ancestors clearly
didn't have vitamin d pills
but anyway so once your body has vitamin
d3 it goes to your liver
and it gets converted into 25 hydroxyd
right which is the precursor to the
active form
in fact when you get tested for your
vitamin d levels that's what they look
at but anyway so 25 hydroxyd
goes to your kidney and eventually gets
converted to the active hormone which is
125
hydroxyd right so that's the active form
now once you have the active form of
vitamin d
it goes to your dna and again it's a
transcription factor right it enters the
nucleus of the cell and it starts
helping with gene expression protein
synthesis blah blah blah
oh it also goes to your gut and
obviously helps you retain calcium
that's the part of vitamin d that
everyone knows everyone knows the
effects on bone health and calcium
but very few people know the effects
that it has on everything else i just
mentioned
so of course it goes to your gut it
helps you retain calcium helps you
absorb calcium
keep in mind guys you also need
magnesium for all this to work so if
you're deficient in magnesium you can
say goodbye to that
and again that gives you strong healthy
bones blah blah blah right
if you don't have enough vitamin d and
you obviously have low calcium
absorption
you end up with [ __ ] rickets right so
a lot of you guys especially the
older people know what rackets are he's
pretty much being eradicated once we
find out that sunlight and vitamin d
was the number one kill for it uh but
some people still have wreckage
i mean you know that legs come out all
snapped up and [ __ ] right here so bold
and
poorly formed and this this used to
happen to kids
back during the industrial revolution
when they didn't get enough sunlight
right so
low sunlight low vitamin d and their
bones came out all snapped up and [ __ ]
and obviously if you're older that's
going to lead to you know increased risk
of falls
you know all the bone leases and things
like that so that's how
sunlight affects your entire body
now how much do you need the optimal
range is about 40 nanogram right
between 40 to 60 nanogram per milliliter
or if you're using nano mole per liter
it's about
at least 100 now that's the optimal
range it starts out
it starts at above 40. most people
are way below that in fact most people
are around 20
some are around 15 some are even lower
than that
if you had 30 that's the that's when
you're away from the danger zone so 30
is not optimal it's just it just means
you're away from the danger zone
um but optimal is definitely above 40 in
fact
uh people that work at it people that
work in the suns or construction workers
or
lifeguards and things like that they
have about i think it's about 60 to 80.
so they have much higher levels
of vitamin d which is great uh if you
also go to uh
certain countries in africa where you
know you look at the tribes man the ones
who are
closest to our ancestors you know
they're living in the wild they don't
have a lot of clothes on
they're around i believe around 50
nanogram per milliliter
uh anywhere in that 40 to 60 range so
that's where you want to be
and this is 25 ohd by the way so this is
25 hydroxyd levels
optimal dose you need at least 5 000 iu
right you need at least four to five
thousand iu
just to be around 40 nano gram per
milliliter right
depending on your age and the amount of
body fat that you have you might need
more because again vitamin d is fat
soluble so if you have a lot of body fat
you're actually going to have less
vitamin d in your blood because a lot of
it is going to be stuck in your fat
tissue
and there's no toxicity below 30
thousand iu so you could take up to
thirty thousand iu
some studies have shown people taking up
to sixty thousand iu
uh for years and had no issue right so
and if you're old
or you are you have dark skin or you
have high body fat you might need way
more than
and again the sun gives you up to 25 000
ius depending on your skin color and
then what time of day it is and things
like that
uh in less than an hour right so our
body
is designed to absorb a lot of ius from
the sun
right you cannot go vitamin d toxic from
the sun because
your body has mechanisms in place where
if you're making too much from your skin
it just starts to break down so
you good either way the only way you're
gonna
go toxic as if you just try to overdose
with supplements and things like that
next optimal sauces again food not good
enough right like i mentioned earlier
fish is the number one source of um
vitamin d foods but you need to buy 50
ounces to get 5000 iu depending on what
fish you're getting right wild card
versus farm raised
salmon versus tuna things like that but
salmon has the highest concentration of
vitamin d
um but again it's still not enough cod
level oil will give you a lot more two
ounces will give you close to six
thousand iu
supplements one pill can give you
anywhere from five to ten thousand iu
but again like i mentioned earlier it's
not as efficient
and effective as the amount synthesized
by your skin
from sunlight the sun so uvb rays
is the number one source of vitamin d by
far
not only you getting a ton in a short
amount of time
um but it's more bioavailable in 15
minutes gives you about 10 or 20
thousand iu
if you're going at the right time of day
uh with minimal clothing
and if you have a lighter skin yeah 10
or 2 p.m
latitude below 37 so as close to the
egret as possible
now here are some caveats you can't have
sunscreen because sunscreen obviously
blocks uvb rays so if you have a lot of
sunscreen then you're going to block 98
of the sun you're going to block 98 of
the uv rays meaning you're going to set
the size 98
less um no excessive clothing obviously
right your skin has to be exposed
not black right if you're black you need
way more
time exposed to the sun so instead of 15
minutes or 30 minutes you'll need up to
two hours or more
um can be old if you're old you
obviously need more because all people
have a hard time synthesizing vitamin d
which explains a lot of reasons why all
people have cancers and
um insulin resistance issues bone issues
muscle growth issues all of that is
linked very strongly to vitamin d
um can be obese uh the fatter you are
the more vitamin d
is actually gonna be stuck in your fat
tissue so you have to lose weight
and you can't be on a low fat diet
because obviously vitamin d is fat
soluble
and you cannot have a magnesium
deficiency your body needs magnesium
to activate vitamin d and to also
transport it
and you also have to have low stress
right low stress low cortisol why
because cortisol has a negative effect
on your vitamin d receptors
so the worst person this can apply to
rhinos if you
uh old black fat full of stress
on a low fat diet with low magnesium
and wear it too much and wearing too
many [ __ ] clothes right
so you're trying to limit those things
here when you're trying to maximize
that's one of the worst things you could
do for vitamin d and again when i
mentioned the equator
right these are the countries getting
the most uvb
rays and believe it or not even though
they're getting the most uv rays
nowadays a lot of these people are still
vitamin deficient why simply because of
air conditioning are people staying
doors longer
um people don't go outside when the sun
is out you know when the sun is high
and in most of these countries
especially the middle eastern countries
uh people are covered up right in fact
women in those countries have the lowest
vitamin d levels even lower than men
because they cover from head to toe
so they're not synthesizing any vitamin
d
so these are the best regions
for optimum sentences and then you have
some here
and obviously if you live up here you
pretty much [ __ ]
right because it's almost impossible for
you to maximize your vitamin d
production but
based on evolution if you're living up
there before airplanes and boats and all
that [ __ ]
you have very very pale skin so your
body is able to absorb
uh uvb rays a lot better but nowadays
you know with planes and
boats and you know humans going all over
the damn place
we have a lot of issues right because
now you have people with pale skin
coming here and getting their skin
burned and the [ __ ] snapped up
you got dog skin people going to the
north and getting no
sunlight and getting a bunch of issues
so keep in mind guys
millions of years of evolution is not
going to be reversed
in just a few hundred years of
technology
should i say guys conclusion optimal
level is about 40 nano gram per
milliliter
um you want at least five thousand hours
a day to reach that
and as far as safety goes skin cancer
guys if you're white if you have really
light skin
don't snap your [ __ ] up you know 15
minutes
maybe 30 minute max is all you need
right get your sunlight
you can get the [ __ ] out the way right
don't go out there you see there's
always
there's always that person that wants to
overdo everything you know kind of like
uh
how me and my my client were joking
about with the whole blood flow
restriction thing
there's always that one person that's
going to say oh you know
15 minutes of sunlight is all i need i'm
going to go for an hour and then they're
going to come back burnt
toasted and say oh megan gave me wrong
advice so
keep it safe there are some apps in fact
there's an app called let me pull it up
there's an app called uh
d minder really really really good app
it should be free in fact it's free
right now because of coronavirus but
it helps you get enough vitamin d and it
warns you if you're in the sun for too
long whatever
so keep it safe as always consult your
doctor
and why is this information not popular
enough why is no one or a few people
talk about it because there's no money
in it guys there's no money in sunlight
right the media doesn't push things
where you know
companies don't like to push out things
that they can't profit off right telling
people hey go out in the sun well guess
what
if the sun helps lower your cancer heart
disease and all that stuff
that's billions of dollars lost by the
healthcare industry that's just a fact
right that's you don't have to be
conspiracy theories to understand how
you know
how the whole dynamic works right
there's no money in that [ __ ] there's no
money people being healthy
there's a lot more money in people being
slightly
healthy right so they don't want you to
die because then they just can't make
money for you right you can't tax that
citizens
but at the same time if you're super
healthy then there's billions of dollars
lost
uh by the health care industry so that's
one of the reasons why they don't push
the [ __ ] out
and again it's the other reason is like
i said there's just no money you know
because sun is free you know you can't
sell
sunlight you can't be like hey you know
come here i got five ounces of sunlight
it doesn't work like that right
people people just gonna say well [ __ ]
you i'm going outside right and also
vitamin d supplements are super cheap so
there's no
money in um telling people to get more
sunlight
so that's why this information is not
popular but anyway guys go out there and
get more sunlight
if you're doing cardio do your cardio in
the sun if you just want to go out and
sit down if you want to exercise now
everybody's doing homework after the
chronovirus
do your homework house in the sun you
know try to get your sunlight if you
dark if you're a dark skinned brother
like myself
you need way more sunlight so don't play
around
make sure your levels are above 49 gram
per milliliter

hey guys what's going on megan here
today is tuesday so another episode of
cheerleaders tuesday
last time we did uh when we did foods we
did protein so this time we're gonna do
carbs
most anabolic carbs now keep in mind
when i say anabolic obviously carbs
don't directly
uh increase protein sentences obviously
you need amino acids for that
but carbs do have an indirect role when
it comes to building muscle
when it comes to lowering protein
breakdown increasing your performance in
the gym increasing in strength
replenishing glycogen
um increasing your thyroid your leptin
giving you a sick [ __ ] pump which
obviously
plays a role in hypertrophy and of
course lowering cortisol right which is
goes back to her protein breakdown so
carbs do help with hypertrophy
in fact if you're a very very skinny guy
who struggles to put on mass
you guys know i always recommend you
know carbs and they make it very easy to
get your calories in
but anyway back to this video so
obviously you guys remember the
categories you have i'm about to nut
[ __ ] amazing okay bad pure garbage
now let's see where each of those carb
sauces go
and also if you haven't noticed by now
i'm not using fruits i'm not using
um pure vegetables right it's mainly
things that are very high in carbs
i'm gonna make separate videos for
veggies and fruits depending on you know
what you guys want to see
all right let's get straight to it so
white rice i'm going to put white rice
to bad right
um there's nothing anabolic about
[ __ ] white rice okay
the nutrient profile is not as uh it's
not as high
it's not as dense as the other ones on
the list so i'm gonna put this one here
same thing with white bread right
regular white bread
i'm gonna put that on his back when it
comes to uh its effect on protein
synthesis uh from an indirect standpoint
as i mentioned earlier
um the nutrient profile is you know
again it's just white bread
it's processed as [ __ ] next you have
potatoes i'm gonna put potatoes
at uh okay potatoes are really good guys
again you know
much better than white rice now keep in
mind this is not based on taste if it
was based on taste obviously i would
have white
white rice and white bread a lot higher
this is based on
helping you maximize muscle growth so
potatoes
you know good nutrients um and obviously
not as processed as the ones at the
bottom
uh next you have beans beans are gonna
be a [ __ ] amazing right
again if you know the channel very very
big when it comes to
you know trying to get the biggest bang
for your buck beans have protein
now again it's not as bad by your
available as uh
uh animal protein but you know still
protein um you just got to eat a lot of
different beans to make sure you have
everything but
beans are high in protein high in fiber
high in carbs
and high nutrients right so you can't
really beat that so
beans [ __ ] amazing pasta again bad
regular pasta bad when it comes to you
know nutrient density
um let's see regular cereal i'm gonna
put that one as bad and if you notice
all the process [ __ ] is gonna be down
here like
you know especially for super process
and you know they're
uh they have to pretty much add uh
nutrients to kind of fortified
uh sweet potatoes [ __ ] amazing sweet
potatoes are up there right
uh now they're not as uh they're not
above beans right but they definitely
want to come so [ __ ] amazing they're
better than regular potatoes you know
when it comes to nutrients
um to maximize hypertrophy so next we
have whole wheat bread i'm gonna put
that
slightly higher right i want to put that
one out okay above white bread
because obviously you know it's less
processed and it has slightly more fiber
now of course fiber is not anabolic but
you know it helps a lot with digestion
and keeping uh
keeping a healthy gut which indirectly
leads to better gains
same thing with brown rice i'm going to
put brown rice up there with okay
right slightly better than white rice if
you're barking no i wouldn't recommend
it because obviously you gotta eat you
know it's gonna fill you the [ __ ] up
um the barking foods are really down
here but uh you can also bark with the
ones up here right
next chef oatmeal i'm gonna put oatmeal
that [ __ ] amazing now obviously it's
not as high in protein as beans are
but oats also have a lot of vitamin and
minerals
manganese phosphorus copper vitamin b
iron selenium magnesium zinc you name it
right so oats
oh there's a reason why bodybuilders
love oatmeal generation after generation
next we have brand i'm gonna put brand
at okay really good
again it's not as processed as uh
everything else down here but it's
mainly because of the vitamin and
mineral profile right
very very very nutrient dense and very
high in magnesium which is one of the
most
anabolic minerals out there
in fact i'm gonna make a whole video on
magnesium because almost everybody's
deficient in magnesium
and they don't understand how important
it is for muscle growth helps for
protein synthesis
testosterone production insulin
sensitivity you name it
all right next you have milk again
believe it or not i'm going to put milk
at amazing right people
people are wondering wait why is milk on
this list guys milk has carbs everybody
forgets everyone thinks
milk is just fat or protein milk has
carbs and if you watch my video milk
you know i'm a big big big fan of milk
when it comes to packing on size
as fast as possible now of course it has
its pros and cons
for example if you like those intolerant
or depending on how the cow was raised
and all that [ __ ] but
again watch the milk video i go into the
details milk is the savior
for skinny [ __ ] trying to put
on sauce not to mention
again what do you guys think whey
protein comes from right where do you
guys think gasoline comes from
next sugar i'm going to put sugar at
pure garbage
for obvious reasons the only benefit
sugar has is if you're doing carb back
loading and you need something quick
post workout
or if you're doing if you need something
in your interest shake if i sit on
something i use sugar right this is when
i
i need to put something in my intro
workout
shake if i'm training for two hours or
more right
because some of my full body workouts
take a long time and
obviously to try to keep cortisol levels
down i might throw in some sugar in my
shake but other than that
you know there's really no point in um
taking sugar the nutrient density
is [ __ ] trash oh [ __ ] i actually
[ __ ] up this was brown rice that's
fine because it's gonna be right there
this was a brand by the way guys so this
was brian all right this is brown rice
and this is brian but same thing right
they go in the same category
um brian writes about white rice and
obviously brian is going to be up here i
already explained it
and last but not least quinoa quinoa is
the only cog
that goes in i'm about to not category
the only one
and the reason is simple not only is
nutrient dense
right not only is high environmental
minerals but it's one of the only
sources of carbs
that is high as [ __ ] and like this their
own uh for those of you guys we're not
familiar
i destroyed is one of the most anabolic
substances out there
uh for us natty [ __ ] right in
fact there are a ton of studies
ton of studies on the effects of this so
in fact water which is the world
anti-doping agency he's actually trying
to protect this throne on the list right
they're actually trying to put
this one on the list of banned
substances why because there's so much
evidence behind the um the anabolic
effects
of like this wrong now of course you
don't want to get it
from companies they're full of [ __ ] a
lot of times it's
going to give you a bunch of fillers and
to be honest i rather just get it from
foods right
especially just get it from foods and
the foods that are the highest in like
this throne obviously could know in
spinach but mainly quinoa in fact
i'm going to make a whole video like
this one because i'm still amazed to
this day how many people are clueless
about how anabolic this throne is
metabolic on humans is anabolic on rats
it will blow the
[ __ ] out of your bench press in just a
matter of weeks
and it's one of those things where you
can quickly see results so if you don't
believe it you could just take it out of
your diet
and you'll notice the drop in strength
and the drop in size
in as little as one to two months very
very very powerful stuff
and like i said do not get it from
companies do not get it from supplements
just get it straight from quinoa
right wait if somehow water manages to
get it banned because they've been
trying for a while
you're getting from quinoa right so you
can still claim that
but anyway guys that's it that's the
cherry list for the most anabolic carbs
quinoa's in the i'm about to nut
category by far
followed by beans sweet potatoes old
male males and then you have the rest
down here but anyway guys i'm out of
